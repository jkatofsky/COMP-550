"Well a fail is a fail regardless of whether it's your last semester.   You could write the supplemental if one exists for that course instead of retaking. If the course was one of a list of options to choose from, you can choose a different one that is easy to pass without attending lectures so that you don't need to make that one class your full-time job (though some people choose to just fill up their timetable, and some have to). You can take a summer course if it's offered then.   If you think there's a good chance you'll fail, then you need to get in touch with ISS asap if you're an international student to figure out that side of things. You should also make arrangements to potentially stay in Montreal longer than you intended, especially if you have a job or program or something lined up.   All in all, it's inconvenient, but the bureaucratics of it on McGill's end are pretty simple. You just don't graduate, you register for next semester, you take the course, and that's it.

"So I think there are two different classes of arguments you are making here, and I don't really think they have equal value.  On one hand, I completely agree that some decisions regarding covid management at McGill are arbitrary and inconsistent, and some of them are hard to understand. That's definitely a discussion to be had.  However, I fundamentally disagree with calling vaccine passports ""oppression"" in any form, and I don't think that refusing to get vaccinated is a decision or belief that necessarily deserves to be defended at this point. Some people are not vaccinated for medical reasons, it sucks that they can't get the vaccine, and obviously they should not be overly penalized due to not being able to get it. That part I understand and I'm still following you on.  But I'm also pretty much out of patience for people who willingly refuse to get vaccinated even after a year of the vaccine being out, hundreds of millions of people getting vaccinated under high scientific scrutiny with the mRNA shots, and I disagree with putting them in the same group as people who **cannot** get vaccinated, and present them as victims of oppression. They may be victims of conspiracy theories, they may certainly have attenuating circumstances (i'm sure many of them do), and I don't personally hate them, but I think it's completely fair that by making the choice not to get vaccinated against their own interest they expose themselves to not being able to do certain things. And no one will convince me that this constitutes oppression, personal choices always come with consequences. If you can end the ""oppression"" you are being subject to by doing something that's objectively good for yourself and for others, then you were not oppressed prior to doing that thing.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"12/09/2021, 05:15:42",t3_rcaazf,hntggkt,UNKNOWN

"> Every McGill student has an overriding right to a proper education, not merely a subjective feeling of safety.  McGill agrees: every student has a right to a proper education. McGill can also argue in this framework that access to the library is not essential to your education, as the education your tuition pays for is your lectures, labs, conferences, etc. Being able to study in the library in this framework isn't essential to your education.  > barring unvaccinated students from attending educational activities (such as the CSUS review sessions)  Nitpicking a bit here: CSUS review sessions aren't a part of their respective courses, so in this same framework, they're not essential to your McGill education, though they are certainly extremely helpful. If you don't like that argument, McGill can just as easily say CSUS activity -> extracurricular activity -> vaccine required.  As /u/Thermidorien said elsewhere in this thread: the unvaccinated are being accommodated for the strict minimum of university activities.

I think you may be overthinking this.  > More importantly, if it's so important, then why do we choose to allow unvaccinated students in exams, in class, etc?  What are you implying here, is this some kind of attempt at a ""gotcha""? Unvaccinated people are allowed in class despite representing higher risk, not .... because they don't actually represent a risk?  A hard requirement for vaccination has been applied in other Canadian university. It's not unheard of at all. It's a valid approach. The arguments against such a harsh measure mostly revolve around the fact that there are students who *cannot* get vaccinated for health reasons and these people should be accommodated. Additionally, in Quebec, it's difficult to know people's vaccination status, which is why McGill opted for the vaccine passport instead of a measure such as a hard requirement for vaccination which would be more difficult to implement.  It's really not as complicated as you appear to think: people who can get vaccinated but won't are shooting themselves in the foot, in the process causing risk of collateral damage to other people. They are being accommodated for the strict minimum of university activities despite that choice. That's already pretty nice. They are not being oppressed. They should get vaccinated. If they choose not to, they should understand that making the choice to not protect themselves and others despite having a free and easy to access opportunity to may come with consequences, for the purpose of keeping themselves and others safe.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"12/09/2021, 06:55:01",t3_rcaazf,hntpoza,UNKNOWN

"I think it's important to keep in mind that there are a lot of pretty rigid forces pushing in different directions. For instance recently there was a pretty significant movement from students this semester to have final exams online because of covid worries, especially with the new variant.   So basically any in-person-ization is met with a LOT of pushback (there was a lot of pushback about the Fall semester requiring students to be present in person, too, lots of people on this subreddit claimed we wouldn't last more than few weeks before going back online because of massive spread of delta variant).  This is a strong reminder of how much onus there is on McGill to be careful. Basically, the consequences of reopening too fast are much more damageable in the students and public opinion than the consequence of going a tiny bit too slow.  This is very consistent with the Quebec government's policy through covid. Given how... tense things tend to get between the student body and McGill, I can't really blame them for going slowly. Personally I would also much rather have a bit more in-personness, especially for extracurricular stuff, for instance I don't understand why SSMU is still not allowing clubs to meet in person unless they respect strict distancing rules despite the vaccine passport being implemented for these activities already. I think SSMU should be a leader and trying to get student life back on the rails and recently they have been the opposite of that. It really feels like everyone is being extra extra careful and I have to say I get it, I also understand covid anxiety, but I can't help but feel a bit disappointed that we're not able to make more small strides next semester.

"Not sure if it makes you feel any better, but I'm a grad student and instructor, and feel both sad and glad that my course will be online next term.

My own feelings are sad that the pandemic is \*still\* going on--and that McGill, QC, Canada, many places won't do more re: systemic change--but glad that my in-person, 200-student, 1.5-hr class in a room with no windows is now scheduled for online, in part because I'll be recovering from surgery, and, uh, some high-risk instructors or profs have been punished for not teaching entirely in-person.

"Yeah, I invigilated this morning (and this afternoon, rip) and I honestly think that those of us who were handing out exams and trying to have students start as early as possible were really caught off guard by how poorly organized everything was. When they ""trained"" us they focused on some really niche and irrelevant things, but not key stuff like how to answer questions students might have (like ""will i get more time if i got in 30 min late bc mcgill admin didnt realize that they needed to tell students to get there MEGA early due to covid checks??"") and how to have things running smoothly.  What was really upsetting to me was the fact that, not only did they just start at 9h10 when there were barely 50-60 ppl in the fieldhouse (it seemed), but it seemed like mcgill admin/exam registrars hadn't sent out any basic exam-taking tips to students. All the students in my rows were U0 with only like 5 U1s, and nobody knew how to fill in the multiple choice answer sheet, people didn't seem to know that they should use pencil, etc. Like these are very basic things that could have made the whole thing go much smoother and kept anxiety levels down. It was awful to look some people in the face when they were asking me if they would have more time, since by that point for all they knew they only had 2h30 for the exam, and I couldn't answer them because I didn't know—since admin didn't seemed to have possibly foreseen this happening.

But obviously that doesn't mean people should wait an hour to get in. EDIT: I hadn't realized they didn't warn students that they needed to get there early and may have to wait outside so that's definitely a significant fuck up  Obviously I imagine they will try to make things more efficient to make sure everyone can start on time but arriving early and waiting outside a little bit cannot really be avoided when there are COVID processes to follow to get in from outside.

"People in this thread are saying what mcgill should do, etc—but they won't apologize, this is admin! They should immediately move exams online for courses that have been online all semester. If they really want to hold all these exams in person, they should give up on the concept of distancing, have multiple entrances for students, and tell people to come at least 30 min early (sounds like y'all were waiting for more than that, and I'm so sorry that happened). Of course, if vaccination had already been mandatory and the school had that info on file in minerva or something, maybe a lot of the covid theatre that made everyone wait outside could be avoided.  What they should have done, and should do if they actually want to have this be fair to students, is **not start the exams until 80-90% of people are in there.** Does that mean that exams will start at 940, 240? Yeah. But tough shit, that's what it's like with covid right now. The fact that admin doesn't want to acknowledge the realities and did this is incredibly unfair.  I say this as a grad student who was an invigilator this morning; I have never seen anything so disorganized in my life, especially something as high stakes as this. What was particularly egregious was the fact that Math 140 looked mostly like U0/U1 students—experiences vary, of course, but the students in my rows looked caught off guard by how to use the answer sheets, bubble stuff in, didn't know to bring pencils, and were extremely stressed by how chaotic this morning was. And that's valid! Because it was the FIRST in-person exam McGill has done in 2 years, and they chose to make U0/U1 students into guinea pigs for something that fell apart almost immediately. Some students were on the verge of tears when they found out the exam started at 910 (when they arrived at 940), and frankly if it had been me, I would have been as well.   McGill admin failed from top to bottom bc I as an invigilator wasn't prepared to answer the questions asked of me (I wanted to, believe me—everyone deserved the 3 hours they were told they were gonna get) and students today were disrespected. Exams are tough enough without an admin that operates under a sense of delusion near constantly. I hope the next few days/weeks will be better, but if admin doesn't do anything, it honestly won't be. Come to your exams with a full water bottle, start your exam, and go to the bathroom once it starts if you need to, ask your invigilators questions about protocol, and leave early for exams if the lines continue like this. If you have other official outlets to complain, I highly recommend doing that as well.",English,fluffy_seaotter,"12/08/2021, 01:46:59",t3_rb084d,hno0tyr,Humanities

"Nah its absolutely important, not just to do sometimes but to proudly acknowledge the ""trade"" you made.

The more we are open about sometimes taking a lower grade, handing in something a little late, or doing some last minute stuff to give some extra relax time for ourselves, the better the over all work culture will be.   I think already we're getting there in a sense, the underlying feeling and solidarity that every student feels towards getting absolutely boned by exams is such a big booster, not just for me but for so many people.

"> Sure I can take the derivative of a function, find eigenvectors and write a decent paper, but it doesn't feel like I've been able to refine my understanding of the world or learned how to apply my knowledge to any meaningful problems (I've been taught things, but have no idea why they are/can be useful). I understand that I have a very limited sample size of courses, but I also feel like it would have been more engaging if I learned to apply my knowledge.  > My point is that the lecture-conference/tutorial format doesn't seem like a conducive approach to training well developed thinkers (which is the point of university right?). Useful knowledge isn't the ability to repeat a piece of information, rather the ability to use the information in regards to a broader context. And isn't learning also just more effective through application?  I understand how you feel, but it's important to keep in mind that you cannot just turn a high school student into a well developed thinker in a semester. A significant amount of background knowledge must be built to acquire the perspective you are talking out. For instance, in order to understand enough about, say, physics, to be able to solve or think about ""real problems"" with perspective, you need to really master basic physics and math. So the first couple years of a degree tend to be focused on acquiring background knowledge.  While background knowledge isn't massively exciting to think about or to learn, it's required as a scaffold to build on in order to be able to solve problems in a broader context.  Now, obviously the learning process for this background knowledge is not particularly great at mcgill since their approach to these classes tends to be parking a bunch of people in an auditorium, and I agree with you that's not optimal. I don't think they think it's optimal either, it's definitely for economic reasons.  At the end of the day it's possible that the school you transfer to offers a better experience for the process of acquiring this background knowledge, but I don't think there really are a lot of opportunities to take a shortcut straight to the higher level ""thinking"" , which is why for most programs, most universities tend to have similar curriculums.

"I’d say your experience is pretty standard for a first semester student, but I don’t necessarily agree with your conclusions.   University isn’t generally meant to be a bunch of distinct courses. There’s a flow to them, and they do build upon each other. I’ll give examples from my degree, but you’ll find similar ones across most programs.  Let’s look at something like modelling a human limb as it moves. To do that, you need to have a basic understanding of vibrations of multi-degree-of-freedom systems (MECH 315). But to understand vibrations, you have to understand partial differential equations (Math 271) and the dynamics of more basic systems (MECH 220). In order to understand PDEs, you have to understand ordinary differential equations (MATH 263) and eigenvalue decompositions. The cascade goes on and on.  Ideally, a prof should add some motivation to their linear algebra course to explain why an eigenvalue is useful. In my department, eigenvalues and PDEs are used in a lot of higher level courses.  But instead of focusing too much on applications in the 1st semester courses, it’s a lot more important that students improve their problem-solving skills and learn the mathematical tools. It’s understood that the payoff will come eventually, maybe in one semester, maybe more. Some profs should probably stress this more, or add some motivation, but you will get there eventually.  TLDR; you have to crawl before you walk before you run. It’s frustrating you’re not sprinting in your first semester, but you will eventually, either here or wherever you transfer.",Mech Eng,BiggerD,"12/05/2021, 22:22:53",t3_r9n0b6,hndrreo,UNKNOWN

"> Learning it was a waste of time because I ended up forgetting everything...  So what you're really saying here is that it's a waste of time *for you* because you didn't like these courses, but you enjoyed most courses of your degree, just not the mathier courses. Have you considered that you may have learned less because you didn't like them and spent less time on them/had a different attitude?  Considering the fact that different people learn differently, isn't it a good thing to have some heterogeneity in how things are taught, with more theoretical and more practical courses? That way everyone gets to have some courses they do better in, and some courses they enjoy less. It's not possible to build programs around what you personally prefer. At that point it kind of becomes a matter of choosing a university based on how they approach the program you're interested in.  > I know that there are ways to apply linear algebra and McGill offers courses to do that. However, I am talking about learning linear algebra by applying it.  > Applied linear algebra for computer science students would be a very effective and fitting way to teach what most will ultimately use in a professional setting and not in academia.  I think simultaneously learning the basics of something and also real-world relevant applications of that thing is significantly harder than you may think it is. That's the main reason the basics are taught separately.   At the university level (post-freshman) they're taught simultaneously with proof methods, which is also a necessary element of a CS student's toolbox, and has higher synergy with the basic concepts of linear algebra. So when you say that you learned it twice, the second time i imagine you learned more about proofs and proving things than the first time. Removing that component of the course would not help CS students who tend to struggle with proof-y CS courses despite this mandatory math background.  There definitely are valid reasons to learn linear algebra from a mathier perspective in a CS degree in university, it's not just a random decision.  You could definitely hold the position that you prefer CS being taught in a more applied way and that for instance you prefer Concordia's perspective on CS to McGill's, but saying that it's pointless to teach is silly.  > most will ultimately use in a professional setting and not in academia.  So this is the thing. University is not designed to teach stuff as it will be used in the workplace, that's what professional schools are for. You can take professional degrees in programming that will not make you do any math or any linear algebra.  The purpose of studying computer science at university is to try to build a perspective on computational approaches to problem solving and thus become better at programming by having an idea of how to build algorithms, data structure, and how to leverage abstract knowledge (such as linear algebra or stats) to improve computational methods to solve these problems. This higher level perspective is definitely useful both in academia and in the workplace.

With maybe a more complicated final project.  I understand that it is not possible to always accommodate everyone, I am just voicing my dissatisfaction. It is also very difficult to know this stuff apriori to taking a course / choosing a university and honestly I don't think many universities teach the course content that way anyways.  This isn't really about enjoyment and more about learning, if 400 students are taking the course and 100 would've benefited greatly from an applied linear algebra course, then those students have been done a disfavor. For a topic that is so fundamental to many concepts in computer science, I believe this is a problem.  I am also not necessarily advocating from a more practical computer science program (McGill is known for being on the theoritical side and I have enjoyed most of my COMP classes here). However, MATH 223 and COMP 251 in particular should have an applied variant.

COMP 251 is a pivotal course in the CS degree and should be taken by anyone looking to work as a software dev out of university. Just because something focuses on theory and is difficult/appears less interesting to people who enjoy more practical things doesn't mean that they shouldn't be taking it, if anything it's the opposite. Not making students take these courses would be doing them a disfavor.  Obviously, students prefer things they are more used to and more comfortable with. This doesn't mean that they shouldn't be challenged with classes that are out of their comfort zone, since the whole point of university is to extend that comfort zone. There is a reason that degrees are composed of specific classes students are required to take.  It's courses like 223 and 251 that justify choosing a university curriculum over a professional school programming degree. There's no reason to have a university CS program teaching only programming. You attend university to gain a perspective on these practical problem, and building that perspective requires taking at least a few classes focusing on theory/proofs.   Changing these classes to something more applied would be short-sighted.  EDIT: this is going nowhere so I don't think it's worth continuing this conversation since at this point we're just repeating ourselves, but in a last attempt at explicating my thoughts I'm going to extend on what I said previously:  > I never said that these courses shouldn't be taught. In my original post I mentioned that I revisited the COMP 251 book, read and understood it and simply applied my knowledge using programming challenges instead of writing a bunch of code on paper. It's a different ""grading"" scheme that's it.  It's not a different grading scheme, it's a different perspective, that's the whole point. The whole point of going to university for a computer science degree is to learn to think beyond programming, that's what makes it different from professional school. Making the few courses that really focus on this more programming-based is counter-productive to helping students learn that beyond-the-code perspective of computational approaches to problem solving.  You should try to embrace that other perspective instead of fighting it, it's the whole reason this degree exists. There's no reason to make science degrees more similar to professional degrees since these already exist and are already offered for people who want to focus exclusively on the programming perspective.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"12/06/2021, 02:03:15",t3_r9n0b6,hnen3b3,UNKNOWN

It's a different ""grading"" scheme that's it.  I also don't advocate for the CS program to only teach programming. Programming is just a tool to get stuff done. MATH 223 & COMP 251 are courses that could benefit from an assignment heavy grading scheme where assignments are solved programmatically. This does not teach programming, programming should already be known before doing this... (which is probably not known well by most students at the 200 level, I understand that)  I also don't think MATH 223 and COMP 251 are the classes where you should start teaching proof writing. I have had plenty of opportunities to write proofs outside of these two courses. If you already know proof writing then there is no reason to obfuscate the crucial content using rigid mathematics. MATH 240, COMP 302, COMP 330, ... are all courses where you had to write proofs, I have taken other courses that require proof-writing but they aren't part of the list courses on the degree webpage. Of course, when I say this I am talking from the perspective of someone who is not interested in pursing research but is interested in learning.  The ""justify choosing a university curriculum over a professional school programming degree"" argument doesn't hold at the very least for COMP 251 since similar courses are mostly practical at other universities (even at McGill some teachers gave programming assignments for COMP 251).  As for MATH 223, like I said, there are plenty of opportunities to develop strong proof-writing skills.

NSCI 201 is A LOT of memorization, but I'm assuming (could be wrong) that there is already a lot of that in your major, so that shouldn't be too different. NSCI 201 is basically an overview of all the sensory systems, how they connect to the brain (nerve pathways and such), then an overview of the motor system in a similar way, and finally a quick intro to neurocognition. That's basically the class. It can be overwhelming because it's a lot of content, and mostly memorization, but it's pretty doable if you're good at memorization.   The rest of the neuro minor is basically complementary courses that you have to take outside of your department. IDK if they'd let you take BIOL courses, but maybe they would since they're given by the department of biology and not the department of anat and cell biology. On that thought, you could take 2 classes that overlap with your major, this would free 6 credits for you to take electives of your choice (maybe a research 396 if you're into that sort of thing).  I am not super familiar with the PSYC classes because I'm in the computational stream, but from what I gather they're moderate in terms of workload, but often give lots of readings. The only PSYC class I'm taking for my whole degree is PSYC 311 and yeah, lots of readings. The PSYC exams are often about connecting the dots in the content, so you need to have the content memorized but also be able to link the things together even if they were presented out of order in the lectures (which is what they refer to as ""understanding"" for some reason).  The PHGY classes are a bit more involved. If you don't like physics or math don't take PHGY 311. If you want to learn about how the brain works at a systems level, take PHGY 314 (the profs are AMAZING in that class, seriously!). The workload of PHGY 314 is moderate, it's not super intense, but you'll need to work on things because it's going fast and jumping from one topic to another.   That's pretty much all I can say about the classes available in the neuro minor.  Hope this helps.",Neuroscience,NeuroLife07,"12/05/2021, 15:20:09",t3_r9aoei,hnbxehf,Life Sciences

"Because a COMP 250 final should not be testing programming. The learning objectives related to programming are tested in the homeworks, so the exam should test theory.  The problem is that students see a very limited amount of theory in 250, and basically a comp 250 theory exam that wouldn't be mostly solvable with google would be much, much harder than what you would usually want in 250, specifically because an exam should at least contain a big percentage of stuff that students have seen in class (or that they can directly figure out from what was seen in class), and because everything that you see in class in 250 is everywhere on the internet.  So if students have access to the internet and infinite time, there is no way to design a COMP 250 exam without making it way too hard. You can't just make an open-google exam and say ""the exam is designed with google in mind"" because then what you're testing is more advanced than the background CS knowledge you're teaching in 250. This kind of strategy can however work for higher level computer science courses provided that they have the resources to grade it.  But if a prof made a COMP 250 online exam that didn't lead to an average in the As, people would be up in arms on this subreddit about how difficult that exam was.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"12/03/2021, 04:14:25",t3_r7latr,hn100d0,UNKNOWN

"1. You have to look at breakdowns of cases which Quebec posts daily. So lets just look at Quebec since the numbers are easy to find.  75% of all quebecers are fully vaccinated, around 2.5% have 1 dose and the remaining 22.5% are unvaccinated. Yesterday there were 1146 new cases. 624 were in UNVACCINATED, 18 in single dose and 504 in VACCINATED. So in terms of just numbers WITHOUT context it looks similar. BUT in reality you have to look at population percentages. 75% of your population amounts for LESS THAN HALF of your cases and less than 1/4 of your population produces OVER HALF of your cases. See where im going with this?   Now lets look at incidence rates/100k people over 28 days.  Vaccinated 4.27 Single dose 7.86 Unvaccinated 21.19  Vaccinated people have an incidence rate that is 5x lower than that of unvaccinated people.  Guess what? The numbers show that the vaccines are working but there are still too many unvaccinated people which inflate case numbers.  2. The aim of all these vaccines was to prevent severe disease and death. The vaccines are excellent at doing this. So the protection the vaccines offer against infection and transmission is not the main selling point. Its that if you do get infected it wont fuck you up. But nonetheless we got a nice little bonus and vaccinated people are more protected against infection.

"Although I haven't found the wellness hub counselors very effective, I've had a good experience with the psychiatrists. This was last year so it may be different, but I had to wait two months for a session and then was diagnosed with OCD within two psychiatry sessions, as well as prescribed an increase on the medication a GP had given me before and a referral to the OSD. I was able to get a session with the same psychiatrist within a week this year so I'm not sure what your wait time would be, but you will have to get referral from a GP. I am an international student with the IS healthcare so it may be different for you but I haven't been billed for any of the visits so I guess its all covered?   Although I wouldn't say they minimise struggles I have heard and experienced that they're hesitant to diagnose ADHD (for obvious reasons) so if possible I would try to get documentation from your doctor for the appointment.",Physics,wordsalad667,"12/03/2021, 00:07:47",t3_r7k0o7,hn033ij,UNKNOWN

"Yeah! That’s actually the plan.  I should clarify that I don’t have these diagnosis, it’s just highly suspected by my GP, and myself. I’ve done screenings with a psychologist as well, and I’ve been told that by a psychiatrist directly. I just want answers and potential treatment/therapy if appropriate. I don’t have the money to pay for an adult ADHD diagnosis through another medical clinic since it costs 1500-2000$, even if part of it is covered by insurance. The only way for me to be able to afford it is through McGill because it costs a lot less. I basically have to start by the Wellness Hub and then they refer me to the appropriate service.

"A  few things:  * Class averages this year are already expected to be a bit lower, particularly in second year courses. This is not due to an increase in course difficulty, but rather a weaker cohort which hasn't experienced the ""true"" university workload or difficulty and is undergoing a bit of a course correction this year. There's nothing wrong with those students, they just started uni under circumstances that were unprecedented and this is one of the side effects of that.  * There's no reason why McGill would want to push average grades down even further when averages might already be lower due to this adjustment (or readjustment for some). Ultimately, McGill wants its stronger students to be competitive candidates for highly sought after jobs, schools, research, and so on, while maintaining a reputable degree of rigour, because that's (in part) how it earns its reputation and repeats the cycle. Every admission office in the world has surely heard of the ongoing pandemic by now, and will already have measures in place to make corrections when assessing candidates' 2020 performance given that grades were wonky across the board. GPA is relative. Given this, McGill has no incentive to ""downgrade"" a huge portion of its students when other schools aren't doing so and they would be put at a unique disadvantage. Furthermore, even if average GPAs were openly available, what happened during 2020 will not reflect on a university's rigour, as it was not isolated to McGill and happened to everyone, so McGill has no reason to fret about this and make artificial corrections unless it was already experiencing problems before the pandemic ever started. If anything, you could argue that it would be in McGill's best interest to make this year's courses a bit easier than they were in past in-person years to ""bridge the gap"", and some people would even argue that this is happening, or will in the form of curving (I'd personally argue that people underestimate individual profs' and departments' decisions when considering this).  * A good litmus test for difficulty is standardized, larger, generally lower-level courses. Indeed these do seem to have retained their respective pre-pandemic characters. Past exams and assignments are still comparable (or, in some cases, have literal copy-pasted questions, as is the norm), course administration is similar, and so on. Departments and profs also have some autonomy, and don't have too much reason to do otherwise. Of course there are a vast number of courses offered by McGill each semester, and indeed there will be individual courses that have a prof who wants to ramp it up a notch or who is experimenting with a new format that worked well last year or who is just making general year-to-year adjustments to courses. I'm sure there are courses out there that have been made more difficult, and also courses that are easier as profs try to respond to weaker class performance. In general though, there isn't any evidence of a large-scale push to up the difficulty of courses at McGill.",hit rocket bottom,snowflake25911,"12/03/2021, 01:24:24",t3_r72i4x,hn0d8cf,UNKNOWN

"Medical professionals dont bill you for covered services/goods. It gets directly billed to RAMQ which is why you dont pay upfront. I believe this is partially why they don’t put their percentage return rates online, because usually there is a “reasonable and customary” cost of each service/good set by the government that is standard and applies throughout the province, so there is not jmuch if any discrepancy and it gets reimbursed in full. What I would suggest you do is contact Blue Cross and ask them up to what $ amt they will reimburse for thr SPECIFIC diagnostic test you’re getting (is it a blood test, for allergies, food sensitivity, etc because likely they will need to know).  Edit: this is what the RAMQ site says-  “Participating health professionals are those who practise their profession within the scope of the Health Insurance Plan. They are remunerated in accordance with the tariffs provided in an agreement between their representatives and the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux.  The covered services rendered by these professionals are paid directly by RAMQ when you present your valid Health Insurance Card. If you do not have a card, you must pay for the services. However, you can request a reimbursement if you are eligible for health insurance.”  So yeah most definitely the RAMQ sets a province-wide price of services and any provider who ascribes to the public insurance plan agrees to that price basically.

"There’s no way to speed up the process with IRCC once you have submitted your application. And they are delayed more than usual by pandemic issues.  There is a side route which is to cross the border into the USA and then reenter Canada. (This depends on being able to legally enter the USA of course. Or France at St Pierre Miquelon?) The Canadian border agent can then decide whether to renew your permit then and there. You need to have all the documentation submitted with your application in hand and you should be prepared to provide additional proof like showing your current enrolment and classes. You will also have to pay again and will forfeit the previous payment for renewal.  HOWEVER, the border agent in this context has the discretion to turn you away for any reason at all. (That permit says it doesn’t guarantee reentry and they mean it.) This leaves you stuck outside of Canada without the implied status you have during the renewal process and without the ability to legally reenter Canada. And the border agents are often annoyed by people doing this without any other reason for leaving Canada (family emergency, etc.). So this is very risky to try unless you have a really good reason to leave Canada.  I have gone through this process. I don’t recommend it.

"> This only applies to courses that are curved down though, right? Unless I'm missing something, based on the official grading scale, an A is still a 4.0 even if the class average is inflated a bit by an online exam.  This is not really how things work in reality, it really applies to basically anyone. In practice, all grading is mostly comparative. The difficulty of exams, harshness of the grading, and eventually decision on whether or not to have a positive curve are modulated on how students perform on the exam. Most courses tend to have consistent averages through the years, so if everyone besides you is doing well, you will typically find yourself under that average, and vice versa.  Last year was a special case because of covid, students were given massively more time and accommodations which led to significant amounts of abuse with people doing exams together, using the internet to solve the exam, etc, and while averages going up massively for a year due to covid was unavoidable, eventually you do have to cut down on that abuse and for courses that cannot have online exams that are plagiarism-proof, the obvious solution to this is an in-person exam.  A controlled environment identical for all students without opportunities to work together or cheat simply leads to much fairer assessments than anything you can achieve online for the big stem classes.

"I wholeheartedly agree.  I shared the same concerns since the start of online classes. I am exhausted of the cycle of students cheating, honest students being punished for it, and professors having to make artificially harder exams. While my absolute performance between in-person and online exams were similar (e.g., 92% vs. 94%), my relative performance was much worse (e.g., top 5% vs. top 30%). While I don't have a problem with other honest students performing as well as or better than me, I know cheaters are a big part of that percentage, and I know that would not happen if the exams were in-person. Having abnormally high class averages also leads to long-term consequences. I believe there is no better solution for all the problems with an online exam than simply having an in-person exam.  Respectfully, there should not be an option to choose between an in-person and online exam because everyone should be subjected to the same standards. An online exam and an in-person exam for the same material will be very different exams because they will have different questions, approaches, environments, and grade statistics. You cannot accurately compare a grade from an online exam with a grade from an in-person exam because they are not the same exams even if they are testing the same material.  It seems that some students are having difficulty transitioning back to in-person assessments, and this is understandable after 1.5 years of online studies. The studying habits and preparation required for an in-person exam versus an online exam are definitely higher in intensity. This is especially true for second-year students who have only done a year of McGill online last year and this is their first time doing in-person studies. I saw a comment before on another thread from a second year who thought A- was the \*usual\* class average because that's how it was last year due to it being online.

"> Why do you hate high averages on big stem courses? You don't do math without a calculator, you don't write code on paper and you certainly google your way out of problems. There was still a time limit on them, and a lot of them adapted to basically being open book.  I don't hate the high averages, they just indicate that there were major issues with the exams which were not able to test students accurately. Because the students were not significantly better than the year before across the board.  In Science, most of them didn't really have a reasonable time limit since the faculty recommended giving more than twice the time limit the exam was designed for. Additionally, for most of them, really adapting to being open book is not possible. They did what they could. Most intro STEM courses cannot possibly adapt to students having access to google and social media.  For big stem courses, these high averages were simply not representative of how much students actually understood the material. They were artifacts of having twice the usual time to complete an open book exam for which they had access to chegg, google and collaboration with others.   > Online exams were a better judgement of STEM skill than arbitrarily restricted bullshit in-person ones.  I strongly disagree on this. The averages jumped up massively; if everyone is getting an A or close to it, the exam is not testing the content of the course correctly, just like in the situation where everyone fails. If your profs managed to get a gaussian-ish distribution centered around B with open books, open-google exams, that's awesome, and it absolutely is possible for some courses. I am talking about courses for which it is not possible.  Timed exams done in person are not ""arbitrarily restricted bullshit"", they're a controlled environment that forces students to study to do well in the course, and they evaluate how much the students took away from the class.  It's definitely not a perfect evaluation, don't get me wrong, but it's much better than online exams with twice the time, with google on which an absurd proportion of students are cheating on top of it being much easier than usual, for courses that cannot be tested with essays.  > You don't do math without a calculator, you don't write code on paper and you certainly google your way out of problems.  This is not a job interview, the purpose of exams is to test you on your understanding of what is seen in the course.

This is not about how happy you should be with your grade, it's simply that since grading is inherently comparative in big classes you are being actively penalized as a honest student.

"> this all depends what you consider ""understanding the material"". Assignments are a far better test of your understanding IMO. But if we are going to have an exam[we literally shouldn't] jesus christ at least hand me a formula sheet and calculator for math and push me into a comp lab for a comp exam so I can program on a computer.  Computer science isn't programming. They're different things. The learning objectives are very distinct.  > For example, 273 exams last year were very tightly timed and planned according to you having access to class notes or google, and it was a perfectly fair assessment. It was also fast enough that really you couldn't cheat even if you wanted.  That's awesome to hear. All other computer science exams I heard of were 2x time + 30 minutes. I'm surprised 273 not following that guideline. If they weren't, well, I can imagine the exam was comparably difficult to the usual since time limits can alleviate the issues of open-google, chegg, collaboration etc, and 273 is a very applied and somewhat niche course that can include programming components which may not be too easy to google. This is not  the case of other 200-level computer science courses, though, so using 273 to generalize expectations doesn't really work.   > You'll never perform anything that entry stem courses they teach you without access to google and your notes, online and open book just take out the memorization.   You're not in university to be tested on how fast you can use google, you can learn that on your own. The idea is not to model how things are in real life (or in the industry) and see how good you are at that, it's to make you learn something complementary to that that will help you improve in these day-to-day tasks with stronger foundations.   The idea is to learn theory that can make you better at thinking about the stuff you see on google and better at using it. That's why you go to university instead of just doing a technical degree in programming. There's nothing wrong with technical degrees, I'm just trying to highlight the difference in learning objectives. In a programming technical degree, you will be evaluated purely on how well you can program, and often in more industry-like settings.  The computer science you learn at university is complementary to the programming you learn on your own (or in a technical degree), and makes you better at it. Searching something on stackoverflow at work is MUCH smoother if you have learned the theory of what you are searching. If you're not interested in learning anything that's not programming, you really should reconsider your degree choice because honestly your comments sound like you don't understand why you're here, and that may be why you are so convinced so many of your profs are pointlessly torturing you because they suck.  The purpose of exams is to test you on your understanding of what is seen in the course. When you learn basic additions in elementary school they ask you to do it without a calculator so you can show that you listened in class, because it turns out that knowing how to count is useful even though calculators are available. This is the same idea.   Yes, the answers are on google, just like the result of the addition was on the calculator when you were in second grade. The point is to make you learn to get to them on your own so you understand the process and thus have the background to learn more complicated things later.  > I don't cheat because honestly it ends up being me helping others and losing enough time that I score worse[know from highschool]. But also I take no issue with others cheating when the alternative is exam scores that represent nothing of consequence. The system would be better with EVERYONE cheating.  Exam grades only represent nothing if everyone is cheating on them. In a controlled environment they are a reasonable measure of how well you understand the course materials. Not a perfect one, but a decent one. More so than assignments. There's a reason they are still used.  No, online and open book with google doesn't just take out the memorization, it lets you google how to solve the problem, interfering with learning objectives. That's why it cannot be compared to a crib sheet or even an in-person open book exam. Real textbooks don't have ctrl+f on them and you need to have studied to know where to find stuff.  Yes, some courses need to have exams for which answers can be googlable, because that's part of acquiring the background to learn to do more difficult things.  But honestly, from these comments, and the ones about ratemyprofs being positively biased and profs torturing students on purpose, you are coming across as having no idea what university is intended for or how it works, and you don't seem to be interested in learning because you appear to have decided every prof that doesn't teach exactly the way you want is a terrible person (not just a bad prof, a terrible PERSON).

And I see that you have moderated your position and I agree with you, it sucks when someone looks at a 55 average and says ""this is fine"". We agree on that.  My point is not that McGill profs are perfect, it's that sweeping generalizations about McGill profs being bad, or generalizing that profs with lower averages are ""terrible people"", ""torture students"", ""don't care"", ""don't try"" are actually harmful to both students and profs. There are profs who genuinely try and have low averages because the class they teach is difficult, or because they do not have the resources to deliver a quality learning experience, for reasons outside of their control, and are forced to uphold specific standards despite that by the department. Demonizing profs in generalization is never constructive and is actually harmful to the learning experience of students because it presents profs as the enemy when in many situations their revindications to admin are very similar to those of the students. Profs have no incentive to fail students. Turning on them hastily will make the class worse for everyone. That's my problem with these kind of statements.  Now if you were talking about one prof and provided specific examples of situations that are problematic, that's something else entirely, and I have no problem with that. And obviously there's no problem with some profs being better than others. I'm really just trying to point out that presenting profs as psychopaths is not constructive and frankly not fair. Profs are people and you would be surprised to know how hard some of them are trying, even the ones that get labeled ""disorganized"", ""lazy"", etc. There is a lot going on behind the scenes that you are not privy too and withholding your judgement a little bit is healthy. Obviously giving your opinion on the course is fine, but when you start talking about them as terrible people who look for opportunities/excuses to torture students, it's crossing a line, and these statements should be made with a lot of care. Every time you actually moderate your position I find myself in agreement, I just wish you did that more often.  > I would say one should be able to write up questions even about the simplest of university courses that you can't just google the answers to, and would be backed up by say entry level calc courses being completely open book and even letting you use wolfram alpha. You can say that that's really usually not the case and you know what we can agree to disagree, I definitely see your point. No need to psychoanalyze me.  I'm not psychoanalyzing you, just reacting to the things you are writing down. I completely agree with you that there are classes that are google-proof-able, and classes that aren't, and that for classes that are online exams are a viable option if profs are allowed to have strict time limits (which was not the case last year at least in theory). But I believe we do agree on that.  > Another small example: COMP 206 Fall 2020 was conducted in a way where the 9.5 hour final was officially only meant to be a 3 hour exam, and no one I knew of including the very successful people who loved the course and prof got it done in less than 6.5. A lot of those online exams had the difficulty cranked to the point you really wouldn't be able to get them done in person in the officially stated time, and most people who took them needed that extra time.  That was specifically forbidden by the faculty guidelines and as such would have been the case of a small minority of exams, since the faculty explicitly warned profs against doing that. The profs were asked to make exams that could genuinely be done in the advertised time (so in this case 3 hours) in a sit-down setting. Which is why I am claiming that since profs were instructed to give over twice the time the exam was designed for, the exams were easier than usual across the board.  The bottom line is that I believe there is a purpose in in-person exams, and that they are not completely pointless. I understand their limitations and I do agree there are upsides to assignments and online exams as opposed to in-person exams in specific situations. And more importantly I think your university experience would be less frustrating if you tried to see things from the perspective of the instructor a little bit.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"11/30/2021, 00:51:18",t3_r3npc3,hmlphcw,UNKNOWN

"So unfortunately it's going to be very difficult to provide a clear answer to this because the answer is that it varies a LOT between students. These are the main variation factors.  1) Are you aiming for a particularly high GPA? Obviously, it's much harder to get a 3.9+ than a 2.5 GPA. It takes a lot, lot more time.  2) How good are you at organizing your time to free up study time?  3) How efficient are you at studying when you actually sit down to study?  4) How fast do you tend to be at completing academic tasks (unfortunately that's a consideration as well)  5) What do you study?  And the reality is that unless you are very confident with your answers to each of these questions, working 20 hours a week + taking 5 courses + doing a fair amount of other stuff may be difficult. There are many students at McGill who could not sustain this schedule without seeing a drop in their GPA (which, once again, doesn't matter to everyone, and shouldn't). But also, some students do work 20 hours a week and do just fine and meet their academic goals.  I would advise starting with 4 classes and selecting them somewhat carefully and trying your plan, and seeing how it goes.

"My best advice is to show up early, bring a watch and several pencils/pens. Some rooms don’t have visible clocks, and you don’t want to be panicking if your only pencil breaks.   Remember basic stuff, like going to the bathroom before the exam. There’s usually a bit of a wait before using the bathroom, it can cost you an easy 5 mins if you’re waiting for someone else to finish up.  I strongly recommend skimming your exam right at the beginning. Some profs don’t show up for exams, some only show up for a few mins, so don’t expect your questions will be answered with 10 mins to go.  A lot of students complain about the tables and chairs. With the covered floor and old tables and chairs, some are bound to be wobbly and uneven. If you arrive early, you usually have some freedom to pick one that’s less wobbly.  I know I’m repeating myself, but seriously, show up early. Pre-covid, we would have thousands of students cramming through a few doors at 8:55 for a 9 am exam. It’s chaotic, and so relieving to arrive 10-15 mins early to pick a good seat and get yourself in the right state of mind.  The gym and fieldhouse can be a little overwhelming if this is your first big exam. You’re going to have several exams going on at the same time, which means a lot of people running around (invigilators, bathroom breaks, students finishing early, corrections for exams). Some people wear ear plugs, I try to make sure I’m sitting far away from the invigilators table (usually at the back of the room), because I get distracted by their whispers.",Mech Eng,BiggerD,"11/25/2021, 15:51:10",t3_r1z116,hm1mqjf,UNKNOWN

I find that the double major aspect of the degree makes it so that you cover a lot of the base classes in both, but there are fewer opportunities to get into the higher-level classes. You've got to really watch which courses you chose because the required ones don't usually cover all of the prereqs for 400/500 classes, especially in the bio side. You can take BIOL classes that aren't listed, but they might count as an elective instead. I'm taking BIOL 465-Conservation Biology which isn't included, but I'm really enjoying it.  I lean more towards the biology side and hadn't really gotten into CS before McGill. I don't know how it is for other people, but I definitely get major imposter syndrome in most CS classes even though I get good grades. There are always people in the lower level classes that have been programming way before entering university and have side projects to show for job interviews and the like.  I've personally really enjoyed it, especially since the two subjects are very different. It gives a nice variety of memorization (more Bio) and puzzling out assignments (CS).

Being a minority by no way should be enough to get wherever you want. Being a minority myself, I have seen that a lot of people are just using the EDI as an excuse for their lack of merit.

You can hire based on merit and still do your best to foster an inclusive environment where people from different backgrounds are given a fair chance to succeed. Those are not at all mutually exclusive. The vast, vast majority of grad students are selected for selections and scholarships based on merit, both at McGill and on NSERC scholarships. This prof was never asked to not hire based on merit.   The equity requirements for NSERC are not nearly as stringent as he is presenting them to be. The prof is misleading the reader by stating the issue in his application is that he wrote he would hire based on merit; the issue is that he purposefully decided to barely include anything about diversity/equity to specifically make the point that he would not even entertain the idea of diversity/equity being a thing.

"“Merit” is such a subjective term, and anyone claiming they hire purely on merit is at best ignorant, at worst outright lying.  Consider hiring a master’s student.

These are typical decisions for profs, and none of these applicants merit the job more than others.  EDI isn’t telling you to ignore all of these applicants and to hire a 2.8 GPA applicant because she’s a woman. It’s asking you to acknowledge that these people are more than a single number. Maybe one of the applicants was underprivileged and had to work 20 hours per week to pay their bills.

However, a more charitable reading of this phrase might lead one to think that he's simply saying ""I will ensure everyone who joins my group will get a fair shake because that's important, but I really don't think you need to be asking about this on every grant application"". The underlying message -- that maybe the pendulum has swung too far -- should be considered.  This has to be interpreted in context. The issue isn't fundamentally what he wrote (no one, not me, not NSERC, not McGill, is claiming that it's wrong to hire people based on their qualification), it's what he didn't write. Basically NSERC is very clear about what type of EDI statement they expect and he explicitly decided to not include an appropriate statement and instead state something about hiring the most qualified people. That's sending a strong message. It's not me constructing an interpretation of that one sentence.  The guy intentionally decided to not receive funding by taking a stand against the idea of putting an appropriate statement about fostering an inclusive environment and sharing steps that can be taken to help inclusiveness, and then decided to go out on a massive rant blaming it on the ""woke"". It is what it is. That's what I'm reacting to, and I don't think my reaction is particularly unfair.  Had he just gotten rejected for taking a stand I wouldn't even have commented on it. I'm reacting to him intentionally making this public, and openly lying about how NSERC wants to stop him from hiring people based on merit.   >  In the same way that you suggest he's constructing this ethereal boogeyman of ""wokeism"" when it's really not there  He repeatedly blames this on ""the woke"" in the article, I'm not suggesting anything here, I'm going off the words he said.  > I could just as well take his comments as saying ""I believe in the principles of EDI, especially being a minority myself, but I also believe that their application has gone too far"". I don't think that would be an unreasonable stance at all.  But that's the thing; all he had to do was include a vague statement about fostering an inclusive environment, include steps in making his lab more inclusive, that kind of stuff. Very standard for grant applications. Arguing the NSERC policies have gone too far doesn't make a lot of sense when all they are asking is an acknowledgement. I feel like it's not that hard to compromise with an acknowledgement.

"I wouldn't have that interpretation if he didn't come out in the news to blame it all on the ""woke"". I think his conception of woke students having infected NSERC is reactionary and honestly quite silly. I don't think it's a valid position to oppose EDI to take a stand against the woke.  I do agree with hiring on merit though, and so does NSERC. So if that's his issue with the EDI expectations from NSERC, he didn't read the documentation.  I think your interpretation of the EDI section is very moral and political and I understand where you come from and I don't disagree with you fundamentally. I'm however a little more pragmatic on the question.  I think making PIs think about EDI related challenges their students could face and making them discuss ways of having a more inclusive lab cannot hurt, and is meant to raise awareness in science.  I think your comparison to an anthem is faulty because an anthem is purely political and doesn't actually improve people's life. This isn't just team EDI vs the other team. Making labs more inclusive does lead to improvements for students, and making profs think about this when they apply for money can absolutely make them more aware of why and how these changes could be made.  I think your claim that no one ever changes how they run their workplace/act within it because of EDI awareness is cynical. Personally I've changed things. I think others do too. It's only ""forcing you to sing the anthem"" or asking you to lie if you fundamentally reject the idea of wanting to make your lab more inclusive. What's so horrible about that that it justifies tanking your grant application? What's the upside of just straight up refusing to listen and blaming the woke for ruining the world?

I don't think this man is a politician or a great moral thinker, i think he's a teacher that just wants to do his work without being bothered with grant application specificities, and who feels he was unjustly judged on his position on EDI, especially as a minority himself. I understand why someone in his position would want to lash out, that makes perfect sense, it's the human thing to do.  I think this is where we disagree. We are talking about someone who has a history about being very open about their ""anti-woke"" policies according to multiple recounts of the content of their public instagram account. If those witnesses are correct, the news article is not an emotional response to a bad surprise as you are painting it, but rather one more public iteration of his political stance against the woke, supported by a misleading representation of why his funding was rejected after he applied knowing he wasn't fulfilling the requirements.   Obviously this is conditional to the content of that account which I am currently trying to gain more information on and I will revise my position of the recounts I have seen turn out to be incorrect.

"No, it doesn't.  In general, class averages actually go up sometimes because the people who are left in the program are those who got that far in the program, and because the goal of 400-500 level courses is more to add some sprinkles and let you specialize or produce your own work rather than to pass or fail you.  Generally courses with the lowest average are in the ""core"" of the program - a handful of 200 or 300 level courses that get to the meat of what you're studying and act as a right of passage of sorts.  As for the students themselves, some indeed do go down as things get harder, especially people who kind of skated by in lower level courses. Other people improve as they improve their study strategies and develop the right skills to handle the university workload.  So it really depends on the person.

This varies depending on which pair of courses you're looking at, but given that three people have asked it's worth looking into 212 a bit more.

"There are very few true ""bird"" courses at McGill. Even the reputed ones don't usually have ridiculously high averages. In terms of decently easy courses, there are too many to count, but just don't be one of those people who takes an ""easy elective"" that they know nothing about and have no interest in for the A and then finds themselves praying to Minerva for a B.  Make a list of potential courses that you're genuinely interested in and think you'd be decently good at. There are lots of cool ""general interest"" or 200 level intro courses out there. Then look on the crowdsourced class averages database and cross out any course that averages less than a B+. Then look at what you have left and do a bit of research on those courses and pick one that you like and doesn't have a reputation for heavy workload or anything. A course that kind of fluctuates from B+ to the occasional A- would be a good choice.  Some good candidates would be courses like:  Several 200 level GEOG courses - I've loved every course I've ever taken in GEOG and considered switching my major after only taking one as an elective. 200/201/205 are all hanging around the A- mark.  CCOM 314 - super fun prof and A avg, but potentially boring material and you need to be ready to write and hand stuff in every week, possible multiple times per week.  EPSC 186 - A- to B+, astrobiology. The prof is great and the course material is interesting. It's the only astrobiology course at mcgill I think.  ATOC 184 - Learn about storms n shit. Some people love it, others find it crazy boring. A- avg usually.  FRSL - the intro courses are typically around A-. Learn some french if you don't know it already.  GERM - same as above - the intro courses are easy, the profs are super fun, and the german department has a great social vibe complete with weekend outings and trips to Java U. Great stress relief class and great on a cv.  MATH 203 - potentially useful, one of the easiest math courses there are, but some struggle at first  ISLA 200 - don't know too much about this one tbh, but a good candidate if you're interested in it  MUAR 211 - with the great Jerry Cain. Listen to really old music for credit. Around a B+ avg usually.  PHYS 180/181/182/183 - general interest phys courses with really passionate profs. Around B+ to A-, but occasionally dip below that.

"Hi there!   You definitely don't need merino wool or any fancy doo-dads to comfortably walk to university and back, unless you're walking for hours straight. The main essentials are:   * A head covering (I suggest a toque of some kind. It doesn't need to be uber fancy, as long as it is warm)  * An outer coat layer that acts as a windbreaker (so a winter coat). Don't think you necessarily need one of those winter coats that look like mattresses to survive winter either. Parkas can get super expensive, and they're often overkill.   * an inner layer (a hoodie, warm sweater, etc)  * T-shirt/long sleeved shirt underneath (depending on temp)  * Jeans are your friend. Sure, denim isn't that great at keeping in heat, but unless you're walking for an hour, it's not an issue. If you need more oomph, even cheap long underwear will do the trick in a pinch when paired with jeans, even in -20C weather. The main important thing is keeping your core nice and toasty. Besides ski pants, I don't have any dedicated winter pants--Jeans are good enough for me, especially since I can always put on a pair of long underwear to get my legs warmer.   * thick socks  * waterproof boots with pretty good treads (don't wanna slip)  * It's good to have a balaclava hanging about for when it gets absurdly fucking cold and your face feels like its being sandblasted by frigid air, but that's really for the rarer super nasty days.   The main important thing is:   * Knowing how long you'll need to be out in the cold each day. If you just need to walk 30 minutes to classes, you don't need to wear a bazillion layers. What you'll need to wear can change drastically based on how long you'll be out there.   *  If you wear thermal long underwear designed for skiing all day or hiking all day indoors, you're going to be in for a really sweaty, miserable time. Once they're on, it's a pain to take off and put on again. So keep that in mind!   * Not all long underwear is the same. I'd buy a few cheap pairs and keep them on hand, but I haven't needed the super duper heattech-y stuff so far.   * Layers are key. You can drop a shitton of money on a massive fluffy parka and it would still suck if you just wore a T-shirt with it. On the other hand, you could save money by buying cheaper removable layers and you'd get toasty pretty quick on a budget.

"The short answer is that having it due before the final increases the chance of getting feedback on the course without that feedback being drowned by comments from students who are upset about their grade, who tend to be overrepresented in course evaluations.  An example of a useful course evaluation: ""the pace of the class was too fast and the slides were difficult to follow."" (notice it doesn't have to be nice)  An example of a not useful course evaluation: ""the course was tremendously unfair""  And basically when the evaluation period goes beyond the final, the latter becomes extremely common. So basically while it leads to more evaluations, the average quality is lower.  I just want to clarify once again that it's not a matter of wanting to avoid negative feedback, it's more about wanting to avoid pointless feedback. McGill does care about course evaluations since they still use them heavily in merit-based salary raises (and McGill likes being able to deny raises), and they have no incentive to make negative comments less common on their private evaluations just for the sake of avoiding negative feedback.

"Yeah, it's like when you're forced to listen to a song you like 2342359234 times, it sucks the joy out of it and you don't like the song anymore. Often when a class is memorization-based the content is designed to have lots of volume and little mechanistic explanations (class that makes you memorize correlations vs classes that explains causal relationships), which makes the class content feel overwhelmingly big but also really empty.  In the end those classes make you go over seemingly meaningless associations of word over and over again just to do a test and get a grade, which doesn't feel like learning.

"Here's my approach.  In theory:  Seeing the hard parts as investments and still focusing on the best part of them. Spending a lot of time on an assignment despite being exhausted? Well you can put music on and at least you're learning things and developing your skills. Appreciating the process of learning and getting better. Appreciating testing what you can do, and ""completing"" something even if it's just for a grade. Things like that.   In practice:  I try. Sure things get hard, they are sometimes about stuff IDGAF about and I don't want to do it. Sometimes I'm tired, I need to take care of other things like groceries and doing the dishes and I don't like having to do the dishes at 11:30pm because I was too busy with school. But I do try to focus on the best parts of every single task that I need to do for school. I'm currently writing something (2 things actually) and I haven't done that in a while, so I'm trying to appreciate the details that go in it. I try to do it in a way that makes me feel like I'm progressing in some way, that I'm learning.  Another that I find helps is making efforts to get social things involved as much as I can. Study sessions, answer people's questions when I can, making and sharing practice questions, etc. I don't know if it's the pandemic (more the initial isolation that came with it), or if it's the fact that I've met the smartest and most interesting people here, or if it's just that I've changed, but I've never been as social as I've been since starting uni. Facing this shit completely alone would be a real pain.  The last thing is the field of study. I really love most of what I study. Sure there's classes I don't care for at all (looking at you PSYC 311), but they're still related to a topic that I love. So, it's less difficult to enjoy the process naturally, without making any efforts.  Well that's enough procrastination for me.

In either class you should expect either the midterm or the final to be pretty hard, and he doesn't curve in general. However, he is a very nice person and usually extends assignment deadlines. In my experience, if you take notes ahead of class you will learn a lot of important math properly in his courses, whereas Roth's can be succeeded in by pure memorization. 358 is also nice because it's a small class so you get to know the prof and classmates better, and most people who take it are quite strong.",Mathematics & Statistics,arealg,"11/23/2021, 19:10:53",t3_r05yx6,hlsxaxd,Math Sciences
"Joint honours is only worth it if you want to pursue post grad economics, otherwise nobody really pays too much attention when job seeking (to the best of my knowledge).

Other than that, it’s mainly just applying the principles into whatever field you go to plus learning how to excel (investment banking I presume is what interests you). All this can be done with these three courses (included in minor in finance) some self-studying and a 150 dollar prep course from Wall Street oasis. It also helps to have a high gpa.

I recommend you begin studying this section because your understanding of the other lectures depends a lot on how well you know the organization of the different regions.

"I think you're looking at this in a very ""one or the other"" way. Either you keep the comp major and struggle through it or you go with english lit. I really don't know that either one is the ""best"" option. There are (supposedly) 143 majors to choose from in arts... what's your rationale for landing on english lit? Is there a reason why you aren't considering any other major? Is it truly the only one you can succeed in?   There are a few things you either haven't mentioned or that might be worth considering:  * Some people pursue a major for passion. Others do so to make themselves marketable and to pursue a life and a lifestyle that they want. This depends a lot on which category you fall into. Is english lit something that you're passionate about or something that you think is useful? * With a comp degree, even though you might not get a 4.0 (or even a 3.0), you don't necessarily need one either. It can definitely matter in some instances, but graduating with a 2.5 gpa in comp isn't a death sentence. On the other hand, if you're studying english literature you might be thinking of paths that lend more weight to your gpa (or you might not, I don't know). It's good to have a high gpa, but it's also important to look at it in the context of what you need it for.  * Is your struggle fixable? A lot of people go from major to major in the first couple of years of their undergrad thinking that each one will represent a turning point for their gpa. Obviously, everyone will do better in some programs than others, but your gpa issues might be independent from your choice of program. This year, it's even harder to gauge simply because this year is harder for most people than the online year, so your current situation might not reflect what would have been if that transition wasn't happening in the background. In comp in particular, your course grades can go down by three letter grades simply for not knowing what to do when you're stuck on an assignment. What do you think went wrong in comp?  * How's the stats minor going? That's certainly a strong candidate for a major if you're doing well in that.  * Regardless of degree, what do you want in your life? What salary? Like offices? Work with people? What sort of career? You want kids? A downtown condo? To live on a farm? Maybe material luxuries aren't very important to you? What lifestyle is acceptable to you? Obviously it's hard to answer those questions in one go and it would honestly be concerning if you had an answer to all of them, but it's worth considering whether your degree is going to give you access to whatever constitutes an acceptable life for you. A lot of people major in their ""passion"", and while that's ok for some, who see that as living the dream, others get really frustrated when they're putting off having their first child and never travelling and getting behind on rent and whatever... and then they realize they don't even like their career as much as they thought. Where you are on this spectrum needs to factor in to your choice of major. For all its shortcomings, things like comp and eng are very practical, marketable degrees, and art history might not get you quite the same kick.   For what it's worth, I personally agree with your advisor (from what I know at least) - making comp/stats your minors is practical and gives you a bit of flexibility going forward. I'm just not sure your rationale of ""I guess I'll choose english lit cuz it sounds like something I'd be good at"" is necessarily enough to run with. I guarantee you that out of those 143 majors, you'd do well in at least 14, so if doing well is your only criterion there should be more than one option on the table. English lit could be viable depending on what you plan to do with it, and the mixture of disciplines generally won't hurt you and is actually increasingly in demand, contrary to what your parents are suggesting (though your choice of which two disciplines you pick could).",hit rocket bottom,snowflake25911,"11/22/2021, 21:52:08",t3_qzscqv,hlowmle,UNKNOWN

"In my second year, I became really unhappy as well. I missed my family, most of my friends ended up transferring to different universities and I missed my dogs back home. I had never owned a cat before, only dogs and various other animals which are more atypical. I ended up adopting my cat, Theo, a flame-point Himalayan cat, around December. He hasn't cured my depression by any means, but its so nice having a fluffy, cuddly boi who cares. I found that having him has definitely helped me get out of bed at times (even if it is literally just for a few seconds to feed him and hide some of his toys around my apartment for him to find later). When I'm really sad, I can tell that he knows and tries to make me feel better by either acting like a fool (chasing his toys around, jumping around, playing with my blankets) or by just nuzzling up to me and purring (actually the best feeling in the world when my cat purrs).  I would also recommend getting a cat that is a bit more mature (for example, I adopted my cat around the age of 3 so he wasn't a kitten so he was a bit more chill). I have a friend in my hometown who adopted two cats, both of whom are elderly cats (both older than 10) and she loves them because they are more interested in cuddling and food more than anything else.  There are lots of great advice in this comment section about cat cafes and taking care of feral cats, etc. I definitely think that is a great way to begin! And depending on whether or not that was something that helped you and made you feel less alone, then you should definitely proceed with adopting a cat!

"As other people have said, fostering or volunteering is probably a better option.   Cats aren't commodities, they're living things that need proper care, and that will for the rest of their lives. You need to be able to feed them (even when you go visit your family over the break), give them attention, give them space which your apartment may or may not have, change their litter box (even in the dead of winter and even if you're on a tight budget), pay for their medical care when needed, and, importantly, not abandon them when it's convenient for you. Cats can live for >15 years, and as with all animals, generally require more medical care in particular as they get older.   Cats also aren't a substitute for treatment, and they won't make you happier in your life or cure the root cause of your unhappiness. They can make the rough days a bit less rough, hence their therapeutic use, but they're not a medical device. Consider getting help in other ways, and using animal companionship as a supplement to that.   To reiterate what's already been suggested, you can look into therapy animals, volunteer at a shelter, or foster a cat if you're able to make that commitment.",hit rocket bottom,snowflake25911,"11/22/2021, 07:38:16",t3_qyyh1r,hlm5jvf,UNKNOWN
"Have you had any pets before?   Throughout COVID I was fostering dogs for short stints with an organisation and it was actually really pleasant. Knowing I needed to feed and walk them regularly gave my days some structure, and having grown up with dogs having them around was great.  But having a pet is a responsibility. It is incredibly rewarding, but you're accepting responsibility for keeping something alive. Feeding, dealing with litter, shots and immunizations, medical bills. Travelling becomes much more difficult, going home for the holidays as an example means you need to have a friend who can take care of it. It's not a responsability to be taken lightly.  In short: yes, a cat could help. Maybe significantly. But unless you are absolutely confident that you can care for a cat and give it a life better than it has at whatever shelter you adopt from, be hesitant. I grew up with cats and dogs my whole life, and there is no way I would have a pet while being a student.

"> Basically I work at a lab on volunteer bases like any undergrads. My PI recommended I apply for one of those awards having that my GPA is high and I can get paid for working in summer. It all game until I saw that I only get paid 6000$ + 1500$ from the lab so total 7500$ for 16 weeks of full time work which comes up to well below minimum wage! 1. How the fuck is this legal? 2. why labs only pay the minimum in addition to the award that comes free that is literary a scam lol. 3. I WONT accept to work under those condition and wondering how much should I ask to be paid extra in order to accept it. I am think that it is fair if the lab pays me 6000$ in addition to the award which sums up to 3000$ a month before taxes.  > Any ideas or opinions? I feel even 2500/month still pretty decent but not 1750/ month which is not a livable wage in montreal at all  So basically while your position is understandable, you're going to struggle to find a PI who will pay you more than they pay grad students.  Unfortunately, basically everyone who does research at mcgill is either unpaid, severely underpaid, or underpaid. For instance, an average phd student in stem probably makes about 7-8k for 4 months, and most arts student doing research are either unpaid or barely paid, much less so than in science or engineering.  1. It's legal because it's not a salary, it's an award. Basically you agree to do a project and you get a lump sum for the project. Because the main benefiter of the project is yourself, you don't need to be paid minimum wage as you would if you were washing dishes. People do research projects for free, and some pay to do them (in the form of research credits). Now don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean that research projects shouldn't be compensated at least at minimum wage rates, I'm just explaining the logic.   2. Because the funding structure for labs assumes that students get paid to about that rate, both undergrad and grad students. A prof would have to justify paying more even if they had the money, and it's not easy to find salary money in grants. Labs don't operate like businesses where salaries can be modulated based on supply and demand. It's a principle that dates back to when stipends were more reasonable and things change slowly in science, unfortunately. Similarly, when a grad students gets a scholarship, their PI will usually reduce their stipend.  3. You're going to struggle to find a PI paying you more. I understand wanting fair compensation but unfortunately that's not really how it works because compensation is different for research projects than it would be in a job where you work for someone. I think it's important to keep in mind that in the vast majority of summer projects, the lab is doing more work for the student than the student is doing work for the lab (which is why the award is not a wage), so there's very little incentive on profs to go out of their way to pay undergraduate students more than the graduate students who do produce more than they receive.  With that said, if you qualify for the FRQNT top-up, you may be able to get more money though, through that top-up, it may be worth looking into.  The bottom line is that research stipends and awards grow slower than inflation and the result is that both grad students and undergraduate interns are underpaid. The short answer is that if you want to maximize money as a student or a recent graduate, it's usually best to not get into academic research. I also think it's important to make a difference between jobs and research projects because your role is much different in the latter so comparisons to wages are a bit difficult to establish.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"11/20/2021, 23:20:28",t3_qyhb5v,hlfz5bh,UNKNOWN
"i feel like being paid ANYTHING as an undergraduate RA is really lucky. It depends on your area but in my department there are so many students who want an RA position so  they're almost all volunteer positions. It's even tough to get a volunteer position tbh. You have to go through interviews and even then, so many students are looking and can't find one. If you're lucky enough to get a research award, my advice would really be to not ask for more.  Here's why - a paid position is so rare to come by and there's a line up of students who would take it in a heart beat. And from my perspective, the prof is doing me a favour by taking me into their lab.    I think to professors and labs, an undergraduate really doesn't know enough to be intellectually helpful. It's more like, they give you lab training in return for your volunteering. You still benefit because you get the experience to hopefully land a paid position later or get into grad school.  I got an NSERC USRA this past summer (faculty of med). I think the standard for labs is giving the minimum $1500 contribution, hardly any profs give more. I agree that it's not enough to live on, I had a part-time job bartending at the same time. And i made more $$$ from bartending than from the NSERC but once again, it's more for the research experience than the cash. Another thing to keep in mind - i hardly ever did 9-5 every day. So it really wasn't 40hours a week, i'd say it was maybe 25hrs a week. But that'll depend on the lab you're at.   It's totally up to you, and if you feel comfortable asking for more than go ahead. But if i were you, i'd be really careful since they could probably find a volunteer to do the same thing and not have to pay anything. Also, maybe ask them if they're willing to pay more than the minimum contribution before you send in your application. Because profs can only apply with one student and students can only apply with one prof.",nocturnal candy addict,greenbananas1200,"11/21/2021, 04:32:35",t3_qyhb5v,hlh0i4d,UNKNOWN
"> Another thing to look into: when I was working in a lab one summer, I made roughly this amount. However, I ended up not being taxed on it because my ‘salary’ came from grants. It made a significant difference. I’m not sure if this applies here, but I would think it might be the case.  You're correct, awards are not taxed, but when you make under ~13k, salaries are not taxed either, so for most undergrads it doesn't make a huge difference.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"11/20/2021, 23:39:49",t3_qyhb5v,hlg1odi,UNKNOWN
"> That is a wonderful way to put it thanks a lot for your explanation. The thing is the project wont be ""mine"". In all lab this is is just a cover. Me you and everyone knows that you will end up doing 9-5 like any McDonalds employee, yes in something u might like, but kets face the facts, we are working the full hour and unlike mcdonald's u really cant not care cause its a living things u dealing with and requires all ur attention  That is not at all how it works in the vast majority of labs. if that is your experience, change labs and bring up the situation to the department.  > PLUS after hours work, and readings on your own. I dont see why would anyone want to do research when they are paid 10$/ hour while you can serve in a bar and make 25$ with no knowledge.   Because research is an opportunity to do stimulating work, learn stuff and open doors for grad school. It's a very different type of opportunity from getting a regular job and that's why people do it despite it being underpaid.  > Its frustrating cause I dont gave family support and I need to use the summer to collect enough funds for retirement, over the year spendings and in case of a dark times like Covid last year. I feel me refusing to work is very reasonable and I know 3k a month is a grade wage but I think me requesting that would he based on needs not position in addition to that the lab is only paying 1000 to 1500/ month for a full time employee, that is a damn good deal lol. Anyway maybe I am just ranting here but I would rather go to my serving job! its sad to say that after 3 years in undergrads and research work  I understand your frustration, but that's not how lab funding works; they can't pay you more than a grad student. A PI cannot pay their students based on needs, they have to pay everyone the same otherwise it quickly becomes very hard to justify.

I spent a long time railing against the system to anyone and everyone who would listen but have have found acceptance for it. My personal theory is that because so many of us are headed to med school, profs who put more value on research are sick of us/ have no patience for students who they see as ""dead-end"" prospects.  The laboratory course series takes a pound of flesh from all the bioc students (PSA for any potential biochemistry majors)-- it's designed to do that unfortunately. I've enjoyed some courses better than others, but what really helped was setting appropriate expectations for prof investment in the courses (frequently low), and the grades I could receive. I also am doing a minor with a very different vibe from biochem which makes it a lot more fun.

"Hey sorry you’re going through this. I think you have two options right now. Is you paper a research paper that you haven’t found or read sources for yet? If it is, it might just be worth explaining your situation to your prof and seeing if they could extend the deadline a little further. If you think your prof will not be willing and/or you’ve already done research/don’t need to do research, just accept the late penalty for this paper and submit it when it’s done as soon as possible. Just remember it’s only one paper and the grade doesn’t determine your worth in school or in life.   The best thing to do right now is break up your paper. 1300 words can be broken down like this: about 150-200 for intro, 150-200 for conclusion, then 5 body paragraphs of about 200 words each. As you write your paper this structure and word count can change, but to get you started on writing it’s usually best to break it down into small chunks.   It’s overwhelming when you think of how many words left you have. If you break up your paper and think of it as 200 word chunks it goes by so much faster.   Start with a thesis. I know people sometimes say leave this for last but just write SOMETHING down. Doesn’t have to be good, doesn’t really have to be a full sentence. If I were to ask you in person what’s the point or purpose of your paper, write down what you would respond out loud conversationally. This is usually a good way to just really put down the barebones of your argument. Worry about refining it later.   For each body paragraph, briefly outline what each paragraph will be about. Nothing too detailed, just jot down maybe two words per paragraph. Then just start writing. The best thing to remember is just explaining the What, Why, and How of each topic. What is it about? Why is it pertinent to your thesis/argument? How does it affect/impact/strengthen/etc. your main thesis?

"They should accept your deferral with sufficient documentation, just stack as much documentation as you can (medical records, police report, note from doctor, whatever else is applicable to the circumstances), and submit it early. In some cases one of those 3""x3"" messily written ""student complains of/suspected"" notes might not cut it. If, for some reason, they don't accept it, you should have grounds to apply for a late course withdrawal, again given adequate documentation, so the overall risk of just getting a zero on all of your exams is pretty low. Try to meet with an advisor before you submit everything to go through it.   Just as a side note, it sometimes hurts your case to defer only one exam, because they'll question why you're able to write one exam but not the other.

Is that too early to request a deferral?",Leacock 132 N' Chill,HitByTheBaked,"11/19/2021, 09:38:17",t3_qx2ps2,hl8ivei,UNKNOWN
">""im simply more prepared for one over the other"" a bad line of reasoning?  Kind of, because it basically looks like you're ""admitting"" to writing the ones you're prepared for and deferring the ones you're not, which is what the entire deferrals system is built around preventing. Your advisor might understand, but in order to cover your ass you don't want your entire rationale to be based on that. They tend to let you pick and choose if you have a really solid reason though, hence the importance of lots of documentation.  There's tons of reasons you could cite. For example, if the exam you intend to take isn't worth very much compared to the other one, you can just say that you want to limit the amount of exams you defer because you don't want deferred exams to interfere with your life next semester, and you chose to write this one because even if you fuck up it's not tragic.  You can definitely be honest and say that you don't want to defer all of them and have them weigh you down, so you're trying to find a middle ground with deferrals vs. concussion. You just want to avoid saying ""yeah I'll definitely be deferring this one because tbh I haven't been to class since the end of September and I failed the midterm and haven't even looked at the final project"".  Talk to your advisor first, ask them if deferral requests are open, and then defer when you can. You can ask them to make sure it's fine to apply really early, but realistically it would look way more sus if you applied the night before your exam for a reason that happened a month prior to that - that come off as a ""fuck I think I might fail"" excuse.  As a side note, because of the one-free-deferral pilot project, if you haven't used your freebie deferral this will be it (first-time deferrals don't have the same documentation requirement and are almost guaranteed to be accepted unless the reason you cite is ""going to Disneyland"").",hit rocket bottom,snowflake25911,"11/19/2021, 13:51:06",t3_qx2ps2,hl95tg4,UNKNOWN

Not sure how they do textbooks in intro ECON classes this year but when I took 208 and 209 I found that the book of practice questions that you could get with the textbook was the best resource. I would go chapter by chapter doing practice questions and then double down in the textbook for chapters where I was struggling to get most of the questions right. If they don’t have that anymore I think that myeconlab is your best bet. Also I believe that the ESA should do review sessions before the final to give you an extra push. I also think that the ESA has a mentorship program starting soon which might be able to help you out before the final and in 209 if you do it next term.

"Classic McGill experience, some profs will try to downplay the cascading workload as something normal. No, having 7 deadlines in a week, 5 deadlines the week before, 5 deadlines the week before that and then suddenly 2 deadlines the following weeks is not normal, it's poor scheduling.   Best advice I can give, having been there for the past 3 weeks is to prioritize your team assignments. Make a sacrifice or two, sadly you are not in a position to thrive, but survive. You will have to sacrifice your grade on an assignment or quiz. This is not the time to be a perfectionist.   Keep a backlog of lectures and focus on your work. Consequently, you have to jam in weeks worth of information before the tests, but that is once again a sacrifice you have to make.   Keep a priority list, the list should be ordered in a way such that you minimize the impact on your cGPA. Once again, some semesters will be like this... some semesters you pull your grade up and some semesters you fight to maintain your grade.  This is the nature of this university, some profs will try to kill you with deadlines and so far I have only received a few one day extensions despite begging.   Finally, recognize that this is temporary, I am finally done with this semester's sprint and could enjoy a day off after weeks of waking up face glued to my monitor and books. For some, McGill is not a marathon, it is high intensity interval training. Some people have the luxury of good course outlines that help them achieve great scheduling, but that is not offered to all. Do your best with the scraps you were given.

You can find some stuff earlier on but the best deals you will find are from lazy landlords who don't care and those tend to advertise last minute.

"Long comment but here we go.  * **For** ***the authentic tea*****, I'd say** [**Presotea**]( **is my go-to.** They range from 7-10$ (if not more) depending on what you order/size but it's totally worth it. I know many don't like Presotea because of their expensive price range, but they make good bobas and slushies. My go-to has always been their Grass Jelly Milk Tea because I love the taste of their milk tea. It's fragrant and the taste is there. It's not too sweet with the ice; it's a perfect consistency. For authentic boba, get panda milk tea. Though, no seating options. * If you are looking for proximity & boba that looks more like a dessert: [Shuyi Tealicious.]( They range from about 6$-10$ (if not more) depending on what you order/size. Shuyi is good as they offer a wide range of boba toppings than other stores (red bean, yellow bean, etc), but I'm not highly a fan of it because they don't have the original boba (that's just me). However, I do recommend their Mango Pomelo Sago...*freshly made*. They have some seating options. * Near Concordia, there's [Nos Thés]( They also make good milk tea and often times a bit cheaper than Presotea. Nos Thés has a vast variety of boba on their menu (located on the marble table). Their tea is good as Presotea, but Presotea's tea taste better. They have seating options if you wanna talk bubble tea stuff ;) Another store near Concordia is Coco and they're okay. Tea is there but it doesn't hit the mark. But they have a cute seating area so it's perfect for dates, you know. * If you're willing to go a bit far, there's a new boba place called [Palgong Tea]( (it's Korean style Bubble Tea, near Fairmount Bagels if you're up for a double date boba + bagels). You get to adjust your sugar and ice, but the tea is not as authentic as Presotea.  I don't recommend Chatime nor Cocobun for fruit-flavoured bubble tea as they often times used powders in their milk tea. Their regular bobas are okay but not as fragrant as Presotea. The Alley is okay but not as great but has cute seatings. BUT, Cocobun is relatively way cheaper for boba (it cost me 5.50$ plus tax for a Large brown sugar grass jelly milk tea). The flavours are there but it's a great start if you don't want to break your wallet.

"So in situations like this it's important to keep in mind what a regrade is. At McGill, even when you officially ask for re-evaluation through the department, another prof from the department will evaluate the exam based on a grading scheme provided by the prof. Similarly, if you do so unofficially and get another member of the course staff to grade your midterm, that person will likely apply the same rules as whoever graded you.  The question that you need to ask yourself is whether the prof determined that citing the studies was an essential component of the answer that needed to be penalize if it was absent, or if the TA who graded you was overzealous. You can figure that out by asking the question to the prof, usually.  If you fall in the latter case, then asking for a reevaluation makes sense. If your situation falls in the former case, however, then asking to be reevaluated doesn't address the problem you have which is with the grading scheme. In that case the logical next step is to bring that up to the prof and ask for a clarification as to why it is an integral part of the grading scheme. If that discussion goes nowhere, then you can bring it up with your VP academic in the case where the prof refuses to discuss the situation with you. The VP academic will be able to contact the prof to discuss the grading scheme, in the case where it is clearly problematic.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"11/13/2021, 19:13:44",t3_qt6v3o,hkhmk40,UNKNOWN

"Preface: I'm a sample size of one, but here goes...  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with the card. The drivers on the other hand...  Let's just say they have been very unreliable. I have been through Nvidia cards with anything from a 970M, 980M, 1050Ti, 1060, 2080S, (no I didn't own all of them, just some reasonably-lengthed experiences with them) and never had a problem that required rolling back drivers. I have had my 6900 XT for 4 months, and every new driver install had to be rolled back for a few weeks. My friend running literally the same set of programs with almost the exact same hardware has had, you guessed it, zero problems with his 3090.  Sure, if you're just in the market for a GPU, then yeah, go for it - that's why I ended up with a 6900 XT (and why I still have it). But if you're looking for a 30-series, like OP, I find it difficult to justify investing almost the same money into a 6000-series.  The 6900 XT has been doing what I asked of it, but the amount of headache to get there is immense. And this is from a guy who literally doesn't use Raytracing or Freesync/G-sync on anything, so if nothing else, I'd be less harsh in my satisfaction with AMD. I don't recall having to Regedit TdrDelay to work around Driver Timeout with Nvidia, nor do I recall having to limit power draw and manually close up the power states to avoid tripping overvoltage on a PSU that exceeds the recommended voltage by 15%. Let's not get into the whole minimum fan curve stuff (since that's never really a problem for me).  Is AMD worth the money? Yes. Is it preferential over a 30-series if you're looking for a 30-series?

"You might want to review what exactly constitutes a valid reason for withdrawing late. It needs to be something that you couldn't have foreseen and has transpired since the deadline. If it's something like ongoing mental health issues, a loss near the beginning of the semester, an unexpectedly heavy workload, etc. that theoretically doesn't meet the criteria because even though it's a dynamic situation, it's not unforeseeable. Unfortunately, they do make it pretty clear that trying to wait it out isn't usually a valid reason to withdraw late.  Definitely next time talk to your advisors directly and early, and do your research on their website to make sure you understand what's going to be expected in any given situation. It sucks, but at least now you know. Sometimes they will let it slide a bit in a borderline case if it's your first W, so all hope is not lost, but at this point you should plan under the assumption that they won't grant it.  Don't stress about it too much - a B isn't a bad grade if you maintain that, and even if it slips further it's far from the end of the world. One bad grade won't make the difference between a grad school accepting vs. not accepting you, getting vs. not getting an internship, or anything like that. Everyone gets bad grades, but people are going to judge you for patterns, not for one course. If you need to let go a bit for personal reasons and get a 70 instead of an 80, that's completely fine as well, and also something that most people have to do at one point.  Note that, for the K grade, this is actually determined by your instructor, they have the final call on whether to submit a K grade. In general, it's iffy whether you want to ask for it because of the impact it will have on your other courses next semester. It's usually better to do poorly in one course than to put the others at risk. If you do move forward with that, and if the prof grants it, you should strongly consider reducing your courseload for next semester.",hit rocket bottom,snowflake25911,"11/12/2021, 23:22:56",t3_qseyta,hke6mku,UNKNOWN

"McGill's success is not dependent on how satisfied you, an undergraduate, are with the quality of your lectures. McGill cares about its research and faculty first and foremost, and secondarily on its grad/postgrad students. Its status as a top institution has virtually nothing to do with undergrad teaching. The ranks are not falling because of you. This is true for any major research university.  Profs are here to do academic work/research. They are not hired as teachers, they are not trained as teachers, and it is not their primary function. They are simply obligated to do it because it comes along with their position. You can't really blame someone for poor teaching when they never learned how, never had the option to opt-out, when they aren't given adequate support resources, and when it's not their main role. Rather than blindly hating on profs, consider whether perhaps McGill should be hiring more dedicated lecturers and more support staff rather than asking someone who was hired to produce academic work to suddenly know how to teach a class of several hundred students.  To name-drop a professor and say that they are ""universally hated"" as though it's a fact demonstrates an incredible lack of maturity on your part, and ignores a ton of context. Firstly, people do tend to dislike profs that give them a bad grade, so naturally, profs that teach harder courses are going to be ""more disliked"" by default, through no fault of their own. They were given a course and asked to teach it. Secondly, saying that they, as people, are ""universally hated"", apart from being simply false, is a pretty petty and harsh thing to do, especially on a public platform while choosing to maintain your own anonymity. You're talking about a human who performs and is probably really valuable in many capacities, both personally and professionally - if they weren't, they wouldn't be where they are. Not only that, but a substantial portion of students actually do ""like"" professors with tough classes, particularly people who do really well with the format and are able to beat the curve, it's just that people who are angry or feel wronged tend to be more vocal. Thirdly, even if a professor's course is disliked by, say, 80% of the students that take it, that's usually at least in part due to the teaching system, not the prof personally, and saying in this case that a prof is, or deserves to be ""universally hated"" is a grossly uncharitable oversimplification. There are absolutely profs who are arrogant towards students, or who refuse feedback - literally any random sample of people will have individuals like that, and I'm not trying to excuse that - but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes than ""*omg literally everyone hates this prof they thrive on our misery and half-ass everything out of sheer laziness*"".  I'm not sure where you're getting the 50% figure from, but if you actively dislike *half* of your professors, then that's almost certainly a you problem, not a them problem. Perhaps consider reflecting on what causes you to dislike them, and whether it's your own poor performance, stress, or circumstances rather than all of them. I highly doubt that most McGill students would agree with the 50% figure. Yes, there are professors whose teaching styles are generally disliked, and absolutely nobody is going to go through university and love every single course and every single professor, but it's not typical to have problems with that many of them.  As for your experience with the courses in general, consider:  * The workload isn't an issue with professors. It's just part of the nature of attending a school like McGill. It was your choice, not that of your professor, to attend McGill because of the benefits that come with that workload (recognition, rigorous curriculum, etc.). You can always go elsewhere if you choose - there are lots of smaller schools that focus on the student experience rather than rigour/prestige. On one hand, you're complaining that you don't learn, but on the other hand you're saying that they're asking you to learn too much. You can't have a totally easy and stress-free course where you learn a ton while finishing your degree in 3-4 years. If you prefer that though, you can always take a lighter course load and extend your degree, which a lot of people do. * While there are some courses where you can skate by and get a good grade without understanding everything, that's unlikely to be true in most cases. based on your description, you might be feeling this way in part because you're in the first half of your undergrad. Simply, no, you're not going to engage your ""wanderlust"" or ""sense of discovery"" in lower-mid level undergrad courses, and it's unrealistic to expect to. An undergrad has to teach you the foundations of your chosen field before you can do any of that. You might feel like it's useless to do plug-n-chug math courses, for example, but these courses are like that by design. They have to get you through all the tedious stuff in order to get you to the point where you can actually start producing something original. That generally only happens in the last, sometimes second-to-last, year of your undergrad, and really only gets going in grad school. It has to be difficult in order to a) maintain a high standard of learning and b) filter people out sooner rather than later, and it has to teach the boring stuff first. * If you're in your first, second, or third year, you're experiencing the full or partial online format. The absolute most you've had is 1.5 in-person semesters. Yes, this format does indeed struggle to get people to ""actually learn"", but that's not the fault of your professors. They also didn't expect to be teaching history to a video camera for two years from one week to the next. Nobody was prepared for it, and that's not the prof's fault, McGill's fault, your fault, or anyone else's. It's just shitty circumstances, and it doesn't make your prof lazy or a terrible teacher.",hit rocket bottom,snowflake25911,"11/13/2021, 04:12:47",t3_qs8zq5,hkf5mvi,UNKNOWN

"OMG yessss. I have to rant about this. It has been my experience too. BA international student here, poli sci.   In my opinion, it’s so true, many professors are not teachers but only highly effective researchers by profession. Sadly, many courses have therefore become filters for ‘the top skim’ rather spaces for student self-improvement and learning. Researches seek ‘the brightest and most influential minds’ to help further their individual and ideological interests (such as getting better funding and tenure [can’t-be-fired-positions], obtaining political power, increasing their social reputation, accessing powerful networks, etc.) and care less about the rest… And while it’s true that large course size does have a strain effect on how much a teacher can tune to each student, many teachers certainly just enjoy the feeling of crushing down a suffering perceived-to-be inferior person, rather than providing nurturing environments for their well being and flourishing. They largely ignore or fail to attempt to make use of the psychological and pedagogic literature on learning environments and teaching skills. Although professors tend to be spectacular and eloquent orators and writers, sadly, many of their course grading approaches focus on regurgitation of content and their lectures or labs lack skill development emphases. It’s very much a ‘go shove it up your ass you lazy bitch’ approach. They don’t say that, but when you go try ti ask a question you get ‘schooled’ rather than taught, all before being listened to, and then you get remembered and punished in grading. Much better to just avoid those profs all together. They’re no different to a textbook in terms of what you can learn from them, but this textbook has teeth and bites. As such, only those students that are able to offer something sexy (networking, money, gifts, etc), have had previous research skill development, are geniuses, or are surrounded by highly educated people, are the ones encouraged and supported and offered the world.   Many profs neglect diversity and differential susceptibilities present in their student populations. Nvm mental health. Nvm epidemiological and demographic variations. Nvm basic human prudence in how you talk to others. This is honestly a huge corruption of universities. In my time here, I was told what to think, not taught how to think. I was punished for speaking my mind, minimized for attempting to do something new and different, and discouraged to continue. One professor in a course of 3 profs even failed me for no reason and with no evidence. Comparisons with other students who had written similar/same answers showed inconsistency in the prof’s grading criteria. And what was the response? “Sue us, if you can” and no, I can’t risk fighting you - you damn bully. I got A’s on both of the other profs components btw- they were actual teachers. I learned from them, but not him. I was certainly profiled for my identity rather than my competence and effort.   Instead, my mental health unnecessarily and cruelly deteriorated substantially. And note, I am still graduating with a high GPA and was even in the deans list of honors this past year. But the essays I wrote were UN propaganda or a forced kiss to their eloquent egos. I detested those courses. Rich spoiled kids and arrogant researchers professing inclusivity, diversity, democracy, etc. but not practicing those values in their own day-to-day. This was a huge disappointment. I cannot believe these people would openly call themselves progressive, liberal, standing against oppression, racial discrimination, etc… it’s disgusting, and it shows in today’s politics and socioeconomic tensions. They produce psychopathy in the name of an ideal moral authority. They exploit discourse, they abuse their status, and corrupt the universities. What can I say? I get it now. I get why Trump was elected. I get why Clinton is so hated. These people are corruption^2.   But what can I do?

"I think it's important to specify that on top of not being selected for teaching skills, profs are not given time to prepare and administrate their classes.  Basically, the university determines the profs' tasks between research output expectations, administrative work and teaching. And in the way that these tasks are managed, teaching is always the last priority.  If McGill actually prioritized teaching and gave profs the time to prepare and run classes, the teaching quality would be a lot better over the board.  But as of right now, the ""disorganized"" and ""lazy"" profs tend to be the ones who simply don't have time to organize things because their boss expects them to spend most of their time working on other things.  The profs that are excellent tend to be excellent despite these constraints, and often make it work by spending less time with their family.  This is especially true for large classes because in McGill's mind teaching a class to 30 students takes exactly as much time as teaching a class to 300 students. So profs in bigger classes are expected to answer students, manage TAs, etc without actually being given any time to do that.   It's a pretty brutal situation overall, for which students putting the blame of the profs (which is understandable since the prof is the person facing you) is very convenient for higher admin who ultimately controls the level of priority of teaching activities.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"11/12/2021, 14:28:02",t3_qs8zq5,hkc38h7,UNKNOWN

But the idea that it is a false understanding of university dynamics that students will come here primarily with the goal of learning, is just gross. Why kill out their curiosity? Don’t these so called magnificent researchers know the devastating effects they can have on students and by extension society at large by doing so?

"> There are so many professors on RateMyProf who have a 3+ average despite a 90+% prevalence of 1.0 ratings in the last 2-3 years.  Starting with this because my other answer is much longer. I'm not sure how this relate to the rest of your points. The average shown is just the average of the evaluations. I would like to see an example of a prof having a 3+ average despite a 90%+ prevalence of 1.0 ratings in the last 2-3 years; I would assume they used to have much higher ratings before and something happened inbetween, such as being moved from an easy course to a hard course?  > Though, Ratemyprof seems positively biased at best. they ""feature"" a big positive review at the very top of the professor's page, and a lot of the reviews come from overachiever types who mistake their A for the professor's ability to teach or the material being good, or the workload not being insane.  I think that stating that ratemyprofs has a positive bias is a conclusion you can only reach through confirmation bias. When you look at negative reviews it tends to be very obvious that they come from students who are upset about their grade.   Students who are upset about their grades are overrepresented in posts compared to their actual numbers for most profs. In general at McGill, there are way, way, way more people who get OK grades (from between B and 100, let's say) than people who get grades lower than that. In the overwhelming majority of undergrad courses there are more students with A than students failing. So if people who have good grades gave positive reviews at the same rate as people who have poor grades gave negative reviews, almost every prof would have great reviews drowning out the poor reviews. This is not the case.  Assuming that negative reviews are representative of reality while positive reviews are ""overachievers who mistake their A for the professor's ability to teach"" just doesn't add up when you look at the comments on the platform globally. Obviously all reviews are biased to a degree but negative reviews are for sure overrepresented in the average case, at least at the level of the comments if not the scores. The variation in the level of bias is also perceptible; the negative comments tend to be more strongly worded than the positive comments, so the comments don't always correlate to the numerical totals. You will also very often find lies and half-truths in negative course evaluations when you compare the comments and what actually happened in the class, when obviously that basically never happens in positive reviews. Some people also post multiple negative reviews when they are upset about their grade, or motivate their friends to post reviews, whereas the opposite tendency isn't really a thing.  The overrepresentation of poor grade-related reviews and the disconnection between negative comments and overall numerical evaluations are also things that appears in McGill-based course evaluations: profs who teach hard courses tend to consistently have much worse course evaluations than profs, no matter who is teaching the hard course. So the same prof teaching an easy course will have great evaluations, and then when teaching a hard course they will get much worse evaluations.  The result of this is that profs who teach hard courses, even when the difficulty of the course is beyond their control (because departments have requirements for the material that needs to be covered and the overall level of the difficulty of some courses), will consistently get bad evaluations no matter how well they actually teach.  TL:DR : course evaluations tend to be strongly correlated to grades but people who received lower grades are vastly overrepresented in course evaluations, both through Mercury and Ratemyprofs. How much negative bias RateMyProfs has can be discussed, but it most definitely does not have a positive bias.  I can understand an argument saying that there are bad professors at McGill, and that a prof shouldn't act smug and brag about having a low average, I completely agree that is super problematic.  But I am struggling a bit more with the generalizations you are drawing. I think this would be a much easier discussion to have if you structured your point as ""why are there profs at mcgill who are so bad, and why does McGill tolerate them?"", instead of ""why are mcgill profs so bad?"", because those are entirely different questions and you're using arguments that should apply to the former as justifications for the latter statement.

"> I believe the easy course-better rating correlation definitely has a lot to do with the fact that it's harder to torture your students and be a terrible person if your course is easy for them to understand. ie a good professor will probably lose far fewer points going to a difficult course compared to a bad one, who will be free to unleash the hell they couldn't when the course was easy.  I just noticed this answer (missed the notification initially). This is completely absurd. You're clinging to irrelevant factoids to draw a global portrait that has absolutely nothing to do with reality. Ratemyprofs is not positively biased. Ask anyone who has ever taught anything.  You don't get anything out of assuming profs are intentionally torture students because they are mean. They have absolutely no incentive to do that. There are not 30% of psychopaths at McGill, and the world doesn't revolve around you nearly as much as you think it does. These people are just doing their job the best they can, and most of them get a significantly bad rep because the courses they teach are difficult, and students get upset when they don't do well.

I don't know if I didn't make my points clearly enough and honestly I did overstate some things, but it's clear you're willing to go to bat for anything ""classic academia"" and are doing your best to take my arguments, make assumptions from them that make them less reasonable.  That's not correct, you can find a lot of comments from me criticizing McGill. I go to the bat for sanity.  > You, being a moderator, came here exclusively to disagree and were convinced from ""go"" that there was not one bit of merit in my arguments and resorted to strawmanning and insulting me. Why engage in any discussion if you're just going to do it in bad faith? I could give you endless examples, quotes and emails not by myself but by other students here and profs, but I don't think it'd change anything for you. I don't intend to try and continue your bad faith discussion. Your behavior has been childish and especially unprofessional of a moderator. I will however thank you for your points as I do believe you made a few good ones that I hadn't considered. I'm aware the world doesn't revolve around me in the slightest, but I'd suggest you gain the same awareness too.  I'm not discussing in bad faith, otherwise you wouldn't be thanking me for making a few good points that you hadn't considered. You can't have both, I can't be making good points accidentally through bad faith arguments, unless I'm exceptionally lucky I guess. You're a university student, you can be expected to be responsible in your takes, and if you say stuff that's completely wrong, people can call you out on it. Just because you disagree with someone doesn't mean they're childish or arguing in bad faith. You may also just be wrong.  Your profs aren't out to get you. Ratemyprofs doesn't have a positive bias. Demonizing profs with low averages isn't constructive if you're not looking at the context: profs who teach hard courses and have a 3.0 on ratemyprofs don't have to be terrible people who enjoy torturing students and who shouldn't be allowed to teach. Computer science shouldn't be exclusively tested on programming. The system wouldn't be better if everyone cheated. You can't just say these things and expect people to not react. You said them, I reacted. It's not childish to expect people to follow basic common sense standards.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"11/30/2021, 01:08:35",t3_qs8zq5,hmlrrop,UNKNOWN

It's proof even the investigator was fed up with SPHR's idiotic antics of making claims pulled out of their ass and then hiding behind anonymity even to the investigator.

If you can find a professor who is willing to take you on for one of those classes it’s fairly likely they will want to keep you on afterwards to research.

">people say work hard and you can achieve anything  I hate this corky free-will fueled toxic saying. Concrete deterministic conditions of existence plays a major role in what we can and will do. The obsession in capitalism of setting high, borderline unachievable goals and the mentality of WORK HARD to achieve these goals until your psyche breaks down, is so sad.   I was in a similar position to yours, where my life revolved around the sole purpose of becoming a physicist. I worked very very hard, 10+ hours a day for years, but I eventually understood the hard way that somethings are inherently dependent on talent, not merely on the amount of time and work one puts in. I was so blinded by this work-work-work mentality to achieve high goals, that I couldn't see how fun and exciting can programming and chess be. Now I'm happier than ever working as a software developper, beeing a competitive chess player, focusing on myself, and more - life is more than what we expect of it to be.  So if I had to recommend anything, that would be to get yourself a plan B, even a plan C if you haven't already and try to be open-minded about them. There are, undeniably, many other professions you can partake in that will provide this feeling of *giving back to your community through helping others*.

If you're in business, working with others will really help too.   Try to adapt if what you're doing isn't working.

"i was depressed when i first arrived at mcgill. i was living in new rez and it really didnt fit me so i moved, twice in two weeks, until i finally found a new family and from then it got better little by little. went from a 2.9 GPA first sem to a 3.8 the next one. give yourself the time to adjust, you already made such a big move in your life, dont let the achievements of others lift the importance of that. im in my last year now and it literally took me 3 years to not feel dumb anymore and to start participating in class. find your path, and again, give yourself the time to do all these things, theres no one recipe or pattern that works for everybody.",Geography,theyellowyouneed,"11/10/2021, 01:29:08",t3_qqhn2j,hk0guzu,Agriculture and Environment
">All of hs I was near the top of my class and playing sports and a bunch of clubs  As JavaSponge has already said, this is true for literally almost everyone here. People are used to that making them distinct or special somehow, but it's a standard, because if you weren't near the top of your class you're probably not at McGill.   You're not dumb at all, you're actually pretty bright, because you're here, you just have competition now, and you've gone from being exceptional to being nothing particularly special or out of the ordinary (this isn't meant personally, just in the sense of academic strength). It absolutely is a big change, but you should try your very damn hardest not to take it personally, even though that's much easier said than done.   A lot of people come to McGill with an identity centred around academic achievement. They think of themselves first and foremost as ""the smart kid"". Throughout their 4 odd years, many people let go of that identity to an extent and start to identify with other things. Since that hasn't happened yet in first year, academic failures seem like a much bigger deal than they are.   Not everyone else is getting by fine. People just like to exaggerate (or flat-out lie) about their circumstances. There's a stigma among first years especially that comes with poor academic performance, and an even greater one that comes with procrastination. Sure, there are people doing really well, but there are also people who will flunk out by the end of the year, and people who will fail multiple (sometimes all of) their classes, sometimes more than once.   Don't panic if you're not getting straight As. It's fine. Don't beat yourself up. Even if you don't do well this year, you can still get jobs, go to grad school, land internships, and do all that fancy shit. Your dreams aren't ruined. In fact, even many of those people who flunk out at the end of the year will go on to do those things. It doesn't make you any less of a person and it doesn't mean you're stupid. This is an adjustment, and it's normal to not instantly do well.   Make a *realistic* goal for yourself for this year. Depending on where you are, that might be passing every course + doing one extracurricular, or getting a 3.5, or getting at least a B in every program course. Don't worry too much about not being a ""star"". It will work itself out in ways that might initially seem almost magical, and you'll be able to get to a place academically/professionally that you're satisfied with in the end.",hit rocket bottom,snowflake25911,"11/10/2021, 04:12:48",t3_qqhn2j,hk11wsl,UNKNOWN

"Hi! I've used the OSD for like three years now so all of this is just coming from my personal experience.  Confirmation/locations/times  1. In the confirmation emails of this year, it says that all downtown campus assessments are in the OSD Exam Centre unless you are notified of otherwise. They've had issues throughout the years of sending location changes last minute, but in the past two years they've been good at sending out email confirmations max 24 hours before. So, if you haven't heard anything 24 hours prior to your test, I'd assume it's at the OSD Exam Centre (near Service Point in the little tunnel/stairs that connect McTav to McLen) 2. If you haven't heard anything 24 hours before your exam but still want to confirm for peace of mind, I'd call them. You can also email, but I'd try calling first so you can get it sorted ASAP instead of being stressed  Spooky OSD Fears  1. The fears and concerns you have re: them losing your exam and/or generally fucking up are valid, as I also have the same ones (thanks, r/mcgill for the horror stories). However, I wouldn't worry too much about the blame falling on you and wouldn't take any extra precautions in fear of this. To my knowledge, these are really rare problems and they have gotten better at training invigilators this year.  2. When you arrive, you sign in. When you leave, you sign out after handing them the exam. That's your alibi.  General OSD Tips  1. Show up for your test early if you can. I was always stressed about them not having my exam, not being at the right spot etc etc. Because of that, I'd always show up 30 mins early if I could just to make sure everything was okay. I'd bring my notes so I could review in the meantime.  2. If you have ear plugs, bring them. Hopefully they're not like this anymore but pre-COVID I remember the invigilators in the larger exam room talking loudly during the assessments, door banging noises etc. etc. If that's something you could potentially struggle with, I'd bring earplugs. 3. Prepare yourself to potentially be assertive. I've had situations where invigilators try to deny me from accommodations because of a mix-up on my end, and even a situation where one tried to pat me down - as basic as this may sound, be ready to stand up for yourself  4. Bring a snack, bring some water and maybe an extra mask if it's a long test  If you have any other Qs, I'd be glad to answer them :) Good luck on your test!",Law,jukeboxwizard,"11/09/2021, 21:40:24",t3_qq6ao9,hjzl4bm,Law

"Departments can hire TAs (Teaching Assistants), who are grad students contracted to help the prof in any way required, from running tutorials to preparing course materials, exams, grading, etc.  They can also hire CAs (Course Assistants), who are undergraduate students who have taken the class before and to the same task as TAs, or graders, who are contracted specifically for grading.   So while it cannot be a completely random person who grades your exam, yes, people from your program can be hired to grade your exam. Graders tend to be cheaper than CAs and TAs. Some departments use graders a lot, others not at all.   Grading is a job like any other, I don't think it comes with particular authority. Someone needs to grade exams and undergrads who have taken the class recently are usually not any worse at it than grad students, if not significantly better.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"11/08/2021, 21:59:49",t3_qpo74y,hjuwbko,UNKNOWN

Love how the school tries to paint itself as so progressive but then as soon as gender discrimination is brought up in regards to the main student organization, they're mute.

"You are certainly not alone! If memory serves, there has been at least two more posts about BIOC 311 this year.  You have every reason to believe that this class is unfair... I think the material is well taught, but everything from the grading scheme to the assessment questions are incredibly poorly and lazily designed. I find it egregious to have an online 45-minute quiz with five multiple choice and two short answer questions worth **12.5%** of the final grade. The stakes are way too high for something graded by so little, and no bad grade gets dropped. The chance that such a quiz will be an accurate reflection of our knowledge in the course is extremely low. The questions themselves are deceiving, subjective, and aggravatingly meticulous. A multiple choice question is in fact an all-or-none multiple select question, and a short answer question requires you to capture every detail correctly. And I even find this ""correctness"" highly questionable because there is so much subjective component to it. Prof. Denis even said the reason he doesn't provide answers for the problem sets is because there is usually more than one correct answer.  I'm curious to know how last year's class average was an A-. At this rate, it seems like this year's class average will be a B- like 2019.

Check with your bank for how much it is. Usually this fee won't even get displayed when you try withdrawing cash - technically you agreed to it when you opened your account.

"Unfortunately, your CEGEP lied to you. Some cegeps have ""deals"" with specific universities for specific courses to be credited. For instance, Org chem and calc 3 are credited at some cegeps but not at others.  In these cases, McGill does automatically grant the equivalency on your transcript. If McGill says you need to take the class, then unfortunately there is no magic solution; you need to get the class credited to graduate. This leaves you two options:  1) Take the class  2) Try to convince an advisor to grant you credit for your CEGEP class, but that sounds unlikely to work out as I have never heard of McGill granting credit for two classes for a single cegep class. It doesn't sound very realistic to cover both gen chem and solutions in one cegep class. Your only recourse may be pity.  If 2) does not work out, McGill will not let you graduate unless you take the class. An advisor has to grant you the credit, and if they don't the only way you can get it is by taking the class.

Unfortunately, a lot of arts grad students still aren't paid at all.  Our model for funding grad school is completely outdated and the results is that grad students are either not paid at all and severely underpaid, and it's unfortunately a pretty... ubiquitous situation in north america, even at universities where money is actually available.  It's become very difficult to do grad studies without external scholarships :/.

"Yes hello fellow class peer! 👋  The best way to study for the class is to study the Linux Kernel. I have been reading through all of the available documentation and through each file in the GitHub.com code repository (a Google search away might I add, no Linux install necessary LOL 😅). If you study the source code long enough, you can see that it is quite simple to understand the material talked about in those 5 seconds.  Think of it this way my peer -- our Prof. is using gzip compression on his lectures, and reading the source code is like unzipping it!   The exams are tough, but if you think about it, how can one expect a computer to do what a computer is meant to do if you do not know what the computer is doing! Silly, that would be!

"Get yourself a block of tofu, 3-4 carrots, 3-4 potatoes (veggie types and amount vary depending on your preference) and a pack of those Japanese curry cubes (get the s&b brand one if you can, Asian grocery stores usually carry them)  - chop veggies and tofu into large cubes.  - heat up a pot, put a bit of oil to cover the bottom, put veggies into the pot and stir fry it for like two or three minutes, till they start to smell good. - throw tofu into the pot. Add water enough to cover your ingredients.  - bring water to boil, add curry cubes (one box of curry cubes usually have two packs of them. Use only one pack) - simmer until potatoes are cooked, usually takes around 20-30 minutes, depending on how large your chunks are. Add additional salt if you need to.   Cook yourself some nice white rice to eat the curry with. Seriously those Japanese curry cubes are amazing. It’s perfect for cold days.   If you’re not as cheap as me you can also use chicken instead of tofu, just cook the chicken a bit before adding water.",Computer Science,Azusa_xyz,"11/03/2021, 23:16:25",t3_qm6dz8,hj7qf7b,Math Sciences

Add in any protein of choice (ground meat like ground beef, chicken, or even tofu is super easy/quick to cook) or omit protein if you are vegetarian!  The sauce is 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp oyster sauce, few scoops of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of rice vinegar, a little bit of water (the sauces are also very versatile for other dishes like the Korean ground beef one recommended!)  Cook the protein first, then add vegetables in a pan & let it cook. Boil the noodles (takes like <2 min) and then drain and add to the pan.

"For veggies - one of my favorite, easiest, and absolutely cheapest soups you can make is the classic [Adam Ragusea veggie soup]( It'll make a ton of portions, too. In general, flash-frozen veggies are easier to cook with, last longer, and are arguably just as high quality as their fresh counterparts, so opt for those if they're cheaper.  For protein - pork center chops/tenderloin is less than half the price of chicken breast (in Montreal) and it's just as lean and arguably tastier. Metro has some really great pre-marinated ones, too. You can cook it in the oven or throw it on a pan and make a pan sauce. A whole pork tenderloin is enough for two or three meals easily.  For breakfast - Breakfast is a social construct which makes a lot of people eat in the morning when they're not even hungry. If you're one of those people, skip the ad made by the grain industry to sell cereal and just have some coffee. If you arehungry, oatmeal/overnight oats/veggie omelets (eggs, veggies, your cheese of choice) are all easy and very cheap to make.  For snacks - buy a jar of popcorn kernels and pop them in a pot over the stove; it's way better than microwave popcorn and a $4 jar of kernels will last you the better part of a year. Baby carrots and frozen fruit are also pretty cheap and relatively healthier options.",Math/Comp Sci Honors '16,The_Atticus,"11/04/2021, 02:04:45",t3_qm6dz8,hj8d9oq,UNKNOWN

No one was happy for me. Turns out they had no idea what being published meant and just didn’t want to say anything. I’m also a first generation student and there really isn’t anyone to talk too.   > weird snobby looks.  Yea I’m used to this.

"Okay so lots goes into making a house, and houses (especially for my family) are tied to a lot of debt. The house (the one we - as in my Grandma’s sibling, not my grandma herself - still own) has been mortgaged several times, we don’t own it outright. Loans were taken to afford the materials, etc. That said, the combined income of 11 people and their spouses, all working several jobs, went into this house. We didn’t just magically have the money, and yes we were poor and are still barely above the poverty line despite owning a large house. You also need to take into consideration how many people lived/live in these houses. There’s 4 different families and 4 generations living in the current house. Not that it’s a competition, but I’m not sure what part of owning a house means that my family is automatically better off than yours. The point of my post is that my family is poor and uneducated, yet smart and resourceful, and they have their own unique accomplishments, *that’s* why we have a home worth millions.  Also, I have an inheritance because my dad died in a car accident... not because he had money left over to gift me. It was an insurance payout. He had nothing. I’m not exactly sure why you found the need to analyze my story and turn this into a debate/an effort to gatekeep poverty. There was no need. Regardless, I know what I am and where I am on the poverty line, I don’t really think I need your help figuring that out.   > did someone say something disrespectful   Yes.

"Hey there, I’m really sorry to hear about your condition. Migraines are truly awful, I’ve had a few friends experience them regularly. Unfortunately, the system in Quebec to see a specialist, especially a neurologist, is a very slow one. You might be better off flying home to see your neurologist during breaks. If you want to see one here, there are two typical avenues: 1: go through a GP. Book an appointment with a doctor at the McGill clinic, explain your symptoms, and they’ll put a request for you into the CRDS, to match you with a specialist. Unfortunately, due to high demand, and because migraines are considered “less urgent” in terms of a neurologists’ needs, expect this to take several months.  This is the proper way to do it. 2: go to the ER when symptoms are at their worst. Again, because migraines are low on the priority list in an ER, expect to wait there for several hours. You won’t see a neurologist then, but the ER doc may refer you to the hospital’s neurologist, and you can get an appointment in a few months. This approach should only be used in emergencies, they really don’t like it if you walk in with no symptoms.  Neither option is great, but you should use option 1 unless it’s an emergency. Unfortunately, the system was struggling pre-pandemic, and the system has had further delays with COVID measurements. Once you get assigned to a neurologist, it’s relatively easy to get regular appointments, the barrier to entry is just high.",Mech Eng,BiggerD,"11/02/2021, 15:09:38",t3_ql4v1e,hj0poed,UNKNOWN

Once you obtain a doctor's note, you then would have to call the Neuro and book an appointment.

Pasta! To start with you can use jarred sauce from grocery store but add your own protein (meat/tofu/lentils would probably work well) and veggies in. Stir fry your raw ingredients first and pour sauce into the pan to heat it up. Mix it with pasta.  If you get more adventerous you can make pasta sauce from scratch. Either in a slow cooker or in a big pot on the stove. It's quite cooking newbie friendly.   Other easy dinner ideas: sheet pan meals if you have an oven; soups; stews. Usually they don't have a lot of steps and you don't necessarily have to be next to it the whole duration. Sometimes it can be as easy as chop -> throw into pot/pan -> let it cook -> done.   You just need to spend the time and money to build up your seasoning collection first. Seasoning makes food much more interesting.,Computer Science,Azusa_xyz,"11/01/2021, 02:00:14",t3_qk3t06,hiu5nr6,Math Sciences

"mcgill actually has group therapy and I think even some clubs that relate to all things eating disorders and I think it could be really valuable to try to connect with them because eating in times of stress and panic attacks is a really tough issue to tackle and having a shoulder to lean on or even a counsellor could help! If not, making an appointment with a wellness counsellor in your department should be much easier and quicker to access than a psychiatrist just in the short term!   Like other commenters noted, there’s quite a few walk in clinics besides McGill’s that can see you within the same day and either get a psychiatrist referral (which you can use to see a psychiatrist at mcgill within less than a month) or just refill ur meds.  Lastly, i think a solid option would be to talk to your stepfather and be brutally honest about how your feeling even if this means he may be upset for a bit.

"I took 131 last year with no previous mechanics background. I passed, but not with a stellar grade. Reflecting back on it, it was mostly because I didn’t know how to study. If I were to take the course again, here’s what I would do: make summary sheets with the key concepts and equations for each chapter (most textbooks have summary portions at the end of the chapter that you can base the sheets off of); do lots of textbook problems, the CAPAs are a good reflection of Ragan’s question style, but they’re useless if you don’t understand the basics behind the topic you’re learning, so be sure to do lots of textbook questions as I find they’re good at helping you apply the concepts you learn without being overwhelming like the CAPAs tend to be; and lastly, reach out to anyone you can ask for help, like the Frezca sessions, or go to a TA’s office hours.

"I mean... I got a 92 in the course and I had trouble with the CAPAs too. They're hard questions (if they're still the same as they were when I took it). Obviously being able to do them is a good standard, but I don't think it's a necessary one.   If you're just doing CAPA and Khan Academy, then it makes sense that you didn't do well. It's not your fault - it's hard to know how to study, but typically all courses like this require a LOT of practice problems, like WAY more than CAPA could give you. The same goes for 140/141/133 if you're in those, and 142 next semester. Khan Academy is really good for learning the concepts, but that's about it. If you just know the concepts but not how to apply them, then you won't be able to solve the exam problems.   You really need to crack open the textbook. Like, desperately. I can't imagine how someone could do well without either that or another source of practice problems. Go through the sections that are covered in the course and do the problems until you see them and instantly recognize them and know what you need to do. This means doing pretty much all of them, or at least most of them. Take the time to look over the concept again if you don't understand why the solution is what it is. You have five weeks until the exam. Divide the number of chapters by 5 and start plugging away. Also, if he gives you practice exams, please do them.

"In theory they can choose to do so, in fact the prof can theoretically give you whatever grade they want for any reason, but it's basically unheard of unless something weird happens (like you had a seizure during the exam or got thrown up on or something). It would be really unfair to your classmates for a prof to just randomly change the grading scheme for you.   Sometimes the prof will announce late in the semester that the entire class can replace the midterm mark with the final exam mark, in which case obviously you'll be in luck.   So in short, no, it's not really possible.   It is possible, however, to have a conflict, and usually if you're writing 3+ midterms in a day it'll count as a conflict, so in the future make sure you check to see if your case counts so that you don't have to write all of them on that day.

"You're definitely right in your diagnosis of the larger problem - in-person classes are a lot harder. A lot of classes, especially first-year classes, had ridiculously high class averages and were far easier to do well in than they normally are. When first-year students get to university, they often go through an ""adjustment period"" and they're shocked and discouraged by their low grades. It's usually a combination of not being used to the higher workload and just realizing that university is hard and that the days of getting 90s on every exam are over. That might be hitting for you now rather than last year because of the online format. That's not to say that this is your life from now on - it obviously isn't, but don't hate on yourself too much this semester - just try your best to adjust your study habits (as you're already doing) and your expectations.   As for the email, as you probably already realize, literally anyone can do poorly on an exam and then claim they were sick, and professors get those emails all the time. In theory they can do whatever they want - they could give you 100 on the midterm for literally no reason - but most professors don't consider any requests for grade/grading scheme adjustments after the fact unless the class average was low. That's not to say that you should/shouldn't tell her, but there's a good chance that the professor will see it as an excuse (depends on how cynical they are I guess), so you should consider that when weighing your options, especially if you intend to cultivate a relationship with this professor.   If you're not planning on asking the prof to change your grade and you just want to give them context, I suggest either not mentioning it or making it clear to them that you're not asking them to make any adjustments to avoid giving off the impression that you're making excuses. Tell her honestly what you did to prepare and see what advice she has. You might just want to ask to meet with her or go to office hours rather than typing all of that up in an email.   In addition to asking the prof, you should try to talk to other people in the class and ask how they prepared (ideally people who did well), because based on your description it sounds like there's a very good chance you were studying inefficiently rather than not enough.  There's a trick to every course, and knowing what that trick is is essential. Students (and TAs a lot of the time) will be able to tell you things like ""oh yeah the prof takes every question out of this book I found"" or ""don't do the readings they're a waste of time, study the lecture notes instead"", which is probably not something the prof will tell you.   Again, don't be too hard on yourself - it happens to everyone.

Asking your prof for some suggestions on future study approach is a really good idea, you’ve stepped out a very important step - realising that there might be something wrong with your study method. I’m sure your prof will be very understanding when you hold this attitude. They’ve been students before (and probably for a very long time) and they’ve worked with students for a long time, they most likely understand a lot of struggle from students when it comes to learning. I’ll probably hold off on mentioning your migraine during the exam, or at least not mention it at the beginning of your conversation or so, cuz that might sound like you’re making excuses, even though you’re not.",Computer Science,Azusa_xyz,"10/29/2021, 22:24:50",t3_qim8ym,hiklh42,Math Sciences

"Don't worry, MATH 140 catches a lot of people off guard, but it's really easy course to learn (and catch up in) in terms of structure. It's a very straightforward, do as many questions in the book as possible, method of studying.  Your success in 140 is directly proportional to how many questions you do, period. If you did, say, 20 questions per chapter to study for the midterm and failed, then up that to 40. It's virtually impossible to not do well on the exam if you do enough practice problems, you just need to put in the hours. Trudeau usually lets the final replace the midterm if you do better on it anyway, so think of this more as a warning flag that you're not putting in enough time. The course was probably designed with that idea in mind. You can 100% still do really well in the course.",hit rocket bottom,snowflake25911,"10/29/2021, 04:43:23",t3_qi2xxg,hih54uy,UNKNOWN

You could skip the locker step also and just bring it in your bag too, but it's nice to have sort of a pantry on campus to supplement what you bring.

"I normally cooks dinner only for two, which usually costs around 10$ if there’s meat, 6-7$ if no meat or small amount of meat (e.g. pinto bean and ham soup, chickpea curry). Some of the meals can be finished in one evening but a lot of times, especially when I cook things in the crock pot, it usually lasts us 2-3 dinners (so around 6 servings). I made a spaghetti sauce this weekend and a chickpea curry yesterday, the spaghetti sauce costed probably around 10 and curry probably around 6 and each lasts us 2-3 meals, so it evens out really nicely. Lunch is usually something like rice, random veggie stir fried with eggs, leftovers, instant noodles, etc. So they don’t really cost that much, probably 1-2 bucks for two max? Leftovers are the best.   For snacks I bake 12 muffins during the weekend. Usually banana oatmeal muffin, and because I’m cheap I don’t add chocolate chips in my muffins. That’s enough to last the two of us for a week. I pack one in small Tupperware and bring it to school with me.

Honestly seems like a slap in the face. Ever since the beginning of the pandemic we've been told that things will start going back to normal after we reach an acceptable number of vaccinations. We've reached 95% vaccinated. When will this end? I've done my part and the vast majority of people have done theirs but they keep adding restrictions to thank us for exceeding their expectations. You can say you follow the science but these decisions do not seem to be made using the current data. Feels like we're never going to go back to normal if even these numbers are not good enough.,Software Engineering,jjtelord,"10/27/2021, 16:32:08",t3_qgyt9v,hi9jo9h,Math Sciences
"I honestly feel like part of the requiring passports is just to stop non-McGill students from going into the library (since they're not allowed and before there was no enforcement of this). I don't really mind, considering once you have the fast past you just flash them your card and it's not a big deal.   The thing that really gets me is that we still aren't allowed to eat in the library. Once it gets a bit colder we're all fucked - I feel like the tents outside Redpath are their temporary solution which is so shitty because it's still freezing cold. It doesn't make sense that we aren't allowed to eat because all the other spaces on campus that require vaccines allow you to eat. Not only is this super annoying but because microwaves and indoor seating are hard to come by it makes me way more likely to buy food which is taking a big hit to my wallet.",Earth Systems and Procrastination,canoegay,"10/27/2021, 21:49:00",t3_qgyt9v,hiawjrz,UNKNOWN
"Just to offer the other side of that coin, if you're coming from the position of supporting vaccine passports in general, there's two main objectives behind it: The first, and the one everyone here is obliquely referencing, is that it allows these spaces to remain largely ""covid-safe"" for those who are vaccinated or those who aren't able to do so. If 95% of people walking through the doors are vaccinated, then you can probably check that box. The second, obviously, is to incentivize people who aren't vaccinated to do so. If the passport system gets dropped once the people in that space hit 80%, 90%, or 95% vaccinated, then you're losing the driver that could push those numbers up further.   You can argue that anyone who's able but unwilling to get vaxxed at this point doesn't care, or that this isn't the purpose that vaccine passports should be used for at all, but it's also plausible that there are holdouts who just haven't been affected much by the passport system yet (remember that it's been in place for only about six weeks at this point), but who can be persuaded to get vaxxed once it takes its toll. Anyone can avoid restaurants and libraries and such for six weeks, but far fewer people would be willing to do it for, say, the next year, especially if it starts affecting them socially or professionally, which it eventually will for many people.   So it really comes down to what you see as being the goal of the vaccine passport, and how many people you think there are who can still be swayed.   In an ideal world the passport also doesn't cause much inconvenience - it should be no harder than showing your ID for an exam or when you're in the library after hours. Clearly we're not at that point, but we may or may not get there.",hit rocket bottom,snowflake25911,"10/27/2021, 17:17:12",t3_qgyt9v,hi9qhbj,UNKNOWN

"Yes, it's very normal to fail one or two courses throughout your degree.   If you know you're going to fail, withdraw from the course. You'll need to retake either way, so it doesn't matter. It won't affect your GPA. Just make sure you're staying above the minimum credit requirements for honours if there is one and maintaining full time status if you're in a situation that requires it.   Also consider whether honours is still worth it - as a rule of thumb, for honours math anyway, honours advisors will generally tell you that if the difference in performance is more than 2 letter grades or you're getting grades lower than B, it's not worth it, and it'll hurt your grad school chances more than it helps (you can get into grad school without honours, it's just harder) and if you're worried about failing two math classes in a single semester then you almost certainly meet that criterion. If you're serious about potentially wanting to attend grad school, it's definitely not too late - many grad schools will only look at your U2 and U3 years, or at least weigh them more heavily - but you should go see honours advisors ASAP so that they can advise you on whether it's worth continuing in honours, and you really need to do your very damn best not to fail courses.   For employment, in general, it doesn't matter a whole lot if you've failed a course.

"As I'm sure many of the McGill staff on this subreddit can attest, one of the easiest ways to deal with cheating is more funding for more TA hours.   One of the reasons I've seen people get away with blatant cheating (myself included, I'm not innocent of this) is that the course professor simply doesn't have the manpower to check people's submissions and deal with the process. In comp courses this is easier with scripts (hence the huge NA wave of COMP250/251) but you still need people to validate those flags and the prof still needs time to formally flag them to the department with the proof and whatnot.

Obviously there is a cheating problem at McGill and it got a lot worse over the past year but some faculties have recently tried to turn it around (I think we saw a significant rise in ""I have NA what do I do"" posts over the last couple semesters). At the end of the day there's only so much the university can do if the students' mentality is that cheating is okay.

"Sadly the “resourcefulness” of these individuals coupled with their free time to network as a result of the lack of necessary studying (due to having all the answers already) probably only helps with industry recruitment.

"> The professors are well aware. Some of the bigger instances of cheating have been acted upon, but the administration doesn't allow any of the professors to actually substantially punish anyone. Because of this, there's some dog and pony show every year or so, but nothing substantial happens. I wouldn't risk cheating or recommend cheating, but yeah. >  >   I think it's important to clarify that it's a good thing that profs aren't allowed to punish cheating directly. Academic honesty it's the kind of thing on which being consistent between class and avoiding overreaction is important. There are few things that are more damaging to a student than being ""convicted"" of cheating for something they did not cheat on.  Now, this only works if the faculty actually dedicates staff to dealing with the cases flagged by the profs, and that varies wildly between faculties. The most common issue is lack of staff to deal with the administrative management of cases, but some faculties have actually been investing more in this recently (like Science), and there are more and more students who actually get in serious trouble. I think covid cheating was a slap in the face of the faculties that forced them to care a little but more since they could no longer ignore it and profs started putting more pressure.  Obviously there are still profs that are given up, and the core issue remains that students are willing to cheat (but since that's an international phenomenon I don't know how much we can do about that).",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"10/26/2021, 13:41:45",t3_qg5orm,hi430ph,UNKNOWN
"> Engineering has a lot of cliques, social groups..

"Just so you're aware, the withdrawal deadline is tonight (Aug. 26th) at midnight.  In theory, you can estimate your final grade based on historical class averages, weight of each assessment, and your performance relative to the class average. You might not care how you're doing relative to your peers, which is good, but it matters in terms of curving, so it;s relevant to your question.  The class average for this course, on average, is a B, or 70%. Assuming a weight of 30:20:50 (assignments:midterm:final), right now, taking a weighted average, you're performing about 20% below the class average. Assuming that trend continues and the class average does not deviate from past years, you're on track to get about 55% in the course, which corresponds to a C.  So yes, based on that (which, by the way, is a quick back-of-the-envelope approximation and not rigorous at all) you will pass, but you should be aware that anything lower than a 55 would get you a D, which is a ""fail"" for required courses in that you'd need to retake the course. Basically this is to say that you're on thin ice, so you're taking a bit of a risk by staying in the course, and it's really up to you to decide what's an acceptable risk, and an acceptable final grade in the course.  You should definitely, 100% reach out to the TAs and CSUS for help with the assignments and understanding course content, and go to the prof's office hours. Try to pinpoint for them exactly where you're getting lost and which concepts or examples you don't understand, and be honest (don't try to cover it up if you're a month behind in the course - you're not the only ones and it's better across the board if you're honest). A lot of people in your position go to the TAs and say ""uhh, I'm lost"" and neither the TA nor the student know where to start. It's like a doctor trying to diagnose you without knowing your symptoms.   COMP concepts tend to build on each other, so go back and understand the earlier material first - a lot of people feel time pressure and don't go back and just try to learn the new material, but you have lots of time (well, enough time), and it's much harder to try to jump in and learn material without understanding its foundations. Make a schedule for catching up, and put in as many hours in early November as you can so that the concepts have time to sink in.   If you want a tutor, you can request one through mcgill tutoring services - they'll usually get back to you within a few days.  Be aware of the final - people do tend to find it harder than the midterm, so try to build a bit of a cushion with the assignments so that you're still ok in case it's harder than expected, and, obviously, study like hell for it.",hit rocket bottom,snowflake25911,"10/26/2021, 07:47:14",t3_qfz7oh,hi37rr8,UNKNOWN

"Unfortunately it takes a lot of time to organize scheduling so late October is not so early, it's probably the latest time they could make a decision.  As for online classes I wouldn't give up hope. If things keep getting better I wouldn't be surprised if many classes over 200 students offered an in person section.  As for the rationale, I think it makes sense to continue being more and more in person, progressively.  All classes under 200 being expected to happen in person is a pretty big step up. It's important to remember that just last month on the sub it was a very popular opinion that McGill being partly in person was a terrible idea, a pointless superspreader, and that the school would close down after a few weeks.  We've made a lot of progress since then as it appears now that this semester is going completely fine, but putting hundreds of people in cramped and poorly ventilated auditoriums during winter may be a bit too risky to go full in person even with the vaccination numbers.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"10/25/2021, 14:26:31",t3_qfhl3h,hhzlqkx,UNKNOWN

"> So, 95% of us got fully vaccinated, followed all of the protocols and, unsurprisingly, mask mandates and other regulations stay the same. I thought one of the big points of getting vaccination rates above 90% was so that we can start living normally again. I hope I’m not the only one feeling like this will just going to be dragged forever and I can’t help but feel let down. Happy to hear all of the thoughts, both pro and cons. (I’m fully vaccinated myself, so not anti-vax by any means)   That's the point, and honestly the fourth wave went great, it ended up almost only affecting unvaccinated people. It might have been pretty dire if we didn't have great vaccination numbers in Quebec. I think it's important to see success in that. Not yet having returned to normal doesn't mean that getting vaccinated didn't have a massive positive effect. It did, it's just that we're still at the point where these massive positive effects are just.. not being collectively fucked.  The problem is that managing a return to normal is non trivial in a province in which the health system was already in shambles before covid, and which is now currently in turboshambles. It will take time to be able to return to normal, but the current situation is encouraging. Regulations have not stayed the same, we've been able to have a lot of in person courses with no distancing (which pushed many users here to say that McGill would be sending everyone home around add drop), and it turns out things have been going, all things considered, pretty well with that. Most stuff outside of school is open and it looks like everything will stay open. There is now a full crowd at the bell center for habs games and festivals actually were able to run through September.  The current situation is very far from being a ""we got vaccinated and now nothing has changed"" situation. We have actually been progressively lowering the regulations over this semester so far and there's no reason to believe we won't be able to keep progressively lowering regulations until things are more normal.

I was seriously shocked to find out last week that there were still capacity restrictions for businesses in Quebec.  Also didn't Legault say over the summer that if 75% of the eligible population got vaccinated by the end of August he would lift the mask mandate? Then we met that goal  ahead of time and he never even made any plan towards this, instead just implementing the vaxport only. I'm fully vaxed and therefore don't have major dog in this fight, but my patience is wearing a bit thin here...",U3 Zoom Studies,CrispyCurmudgeon777,"10/23/2021, 16:53:29",t3_qd8xlu,hhra7nz,UNKNOWN

"> I do, and I see it myself. I’m also talking to the owners who’re telling me that they’re hanging by a thread because small venues/bars/business even pre-COVID were designed in such a way that they can’t stay afloat for long with limited capacities (bars and small venues are still are under the limitations I believe).   The government has already announced that bars and restaurants were going back to full capacity on November 1st.     This is a direct result of Quebec having mostly resisted to the fourth wave, most likely due to the vaccination numbers.  > Which of course means that there are less opportunities or/and they’re not well payed. All of the government benefits are long gone, so.. Very glad to see the progress, don’t get me wrong! I just hope we can see the promises fulfilled, that’s all  It's obvious that public health measures affect people and industries. But I think it's important to keep in mind that when the government says ""getting vaccinated will help us get back to normal"", it's not as simple as a promise between you and them, it's a process where we expect the vaccination numbers to lead to fewer cases and better public health situation which can then lead to reducing the measures. There's an important third party here.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"10/22/2021, 04:27:14",t3_qd8xlu,hhkz19i,UNKNOWN
"> how would opening things up ""throw away everything we've done so far?"" If we're almost entirely vaccinated and only those who are vaccinated are allowed to attend venues then how could simply allowing people to play at events send us back into a fall 2020 scenario?  I think you're misrepresenting my point. The whole point I'm making in this thread is that **we are already opening things up**. I did not say that allowing people to play at events (which is something that is already happening) would send us back into a Fall 2020 scenario  What I am saying in the comment you are responding to is that choosing not to reopen progressively is pointlessly risky. Even with our current progressive reopening, the hospital stats are still concerning, and we are still vulnerable to our hospitals being overflowed; it's already happening elsewhere in Canada, right now.  Thus, we cannot just ""go back to normal"" and just lift all/most of the restrictions at once, it has to be more progressive than that, and in the current situation we are progressively getting back to normal. This was meant as a response to the general point OP is making in the thread which is that they feel that nothing has changed despite the vaccination number, which I disagree with.  I never said that allowing someone to play at events would send us back into a fall 2020 scenario, and I don't think that. Obviously, the details of what is allowed and not allowed can be discussed and obviously the government's strategy is not optimal when we look at the details, but the general level of ""open-ness"" appears to be pretty reasonable to me given the current case numbers and the overall trend towards normalcy.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"10/22/2021, 22:34:12",t3_qd8xlu,hhoenaq,UNKNOWN

For example in Phys 131 we had a lot of things boosting our grade like perusal and CAPA. However Ragan also butchered us on formative quizzes where the average was like mid 60’s. The final had an average of around 70. So I’d say for that class at least, the average will be in the normal B/B+ range.",You may assume 𝜋=5,Aqua314,"01/12/2021, 22:56:50",t3_kw1i8e,gj1w48q,UNKNOWN

"Don't get me wrong, I understand the balancing act our government and health authorities need to perform (slowing the spread, prevent the healthcare system from being under-resourced and overburdened, and all while keeping the economy going). But, given the trends, I'm severely disappointed with Canada's and McGill's response to COVID-19. There is, at the very least, a strong precedent that current containment efforts in Canada will also fail, leading to community spread. That's a scary thought, even if the average incubation period is a conservative number of days. In fact, it would definitely not be a dubious assumption to take that possibility as a given at this point. Since any uncontrolled growth of a population (including viruses) is exponential in nature, promoting slightly stricter safety measures only when a sudden surge of cases cluster around us may not be sufficient to slow down the spread significantly. For all we know, nothing less than the harsh containment efforts in the East can possibly slow down the spread enough to allow more recoveries than infections, and I highly doubt most of those measures are possible to implement here in North America.   Given the trends, Canada and McGill University SHOULD promote remote work, much like Princeton University is doing now.    Our community needs to go above and beyond what's being recommended right now if we want prevention or even alleviate the almost certain damage control that needs to be done in the coming weeks. Promote social distancing. Discourage penalizing students for not attending lectures in person. Consider alternate marking schemes that emphasize remote work.   All McGill University is doing right now is encouraging ill-informed complacency and are not actually preparing students for a possible outbreak. ""Don't worry, wash your hands, consider staying home if you have the sniffles"", is the overall message given in the McGill coronavirus email updates for the past weeks. In my honest opinion, that just shows that our University prefers minimizing the disruption of people's lives rather than maximizing the safety of the members of its community.

"This is just opinion, but I think COVID-19's spread here is inevitable.

"> now at least more innocent African Americans can be jailed and our working class can be sent to more foreign conflicts because a colored woman is in government  Yes, Kamala Harris is personally responsible for the privatization of the prison system in and the overincarceration of POC individuals in America. I bet she's going to egg on Biden to get the US to participate in more foreign conflicts.   Seriously speaking, there's really no correlation between Kamala Harris and these very real issues that need to be addressed.   Saying what you said doesn't actually help address any of the issues America faces right now. Being woke needs to be grounded in the actual reality of how governments function (especially a divided, gridlocked and partisan government with a republican party that runs on a strict diet of proto-fascism and white nationalism). Oh, and the downright racist Republican propaganda that FOX propagates on the daily, especially with regards to POC individuals.   Legitimately, this kind of overly cynical approach helps put Republicans and Democrats in the same league of shittiness, when that is absolutely not the case.   Democrats have been facing total gridlock in America for the last 8+ years, due to the fact that the Republican party refuses to work in a bipartisan manner. Republicans need to be brought kicking and screaming into the 21st century. **When Democrats do nothing, it's because their hands are politically tied.**  While I love people like Bernie Sanders, people who appear too left wing get absolutely crucified in elections within America. Trump won Florida by saying ""socialism"" a bunch of times. It's a real issue.   What politicians do strategically often do not line up with what they actually *want* to do. Keeping that in mind, I don't understand why people dislike Harris so much.   This is the democratic party that managed to win the presidency, win back the senate in Georgia (ofc with tons of help from Stacey Abrams) and retain control of the house. For now, it is *not* the time to dunk on democratic strategy, because it **worked**.  These issues will not be fixed overnight. The Georgia senate race proved that the POC community can have a real impact on American democracy. Kamala Harris being VP *is* a positive thing imo. I think she's more savvy and strategic than you think.   Give her a chance in her role as VP before virtue signaling willy-nilly.  **Edit:** I'm open to changing my mind.

"> ""...republican party that runs on a strict diet of proto-fascism and white nationalism). Oh, and the downright racist Republican propaganda that FOX propagates on the daily, especially with regards to POC individuals""  This is all based in fact. Here's *one* example of *many*:   * When George Floyd died, the talking heads on FOX mainly talked about his criminal record and how violent BLM are in spite of the fact that his neck was knelt on for 9 minutes straight  VS  * Ashley Babbit is called a ""veteran"" and her death is painted as ""tragic"" even though she had an extensive criminal record, and she was a terrorist invading the capitol as an insurrectionist. That's just one example.   And after a straight up COUP ATTEMPT, the Republican party did not unanimously condemn a proto-fascist. That makes everything I said based in reality rather than hyperbole.  As some conservatives love to say, ""facts don't care about your feelings."" Republicans were actively complicit in a coup attempt, and most Republicans in the House and Senate refused to denounce their president after he incited an insurrection. These are the facts.   > No, you never directly said those words but like I said someone brought up legitimate criticisms of Harris and you rushed to defend her  As I said earlier, there have been no legitimate criticisms of Harris that have been properly mechanized beyond vague assertions. I'm not able to engage with something that isn't substantive.   Finally:   **""When Democrats do nothing, it's because their hands are politically tied.""**  > 1-You have absolutely no proof that this is the case  Besides the fact that Mitch McConnell has been on record calling himself the ""Grim Reaper"" of killing legislation?

So no parents actually ended up in jail and only those who were particularly unresponsive were threatened with charges.    Her record seems like a mixed bag, especially since back in the 1990s/2000s it would have been essentially impossible for anyone to have a political career without them being seen as ""tough on crime.""

"> The point was that you called the entire Republican Party racist and ""proto-facist"". That is hyperbolic.  How? How is it hyperbolic? The onus is on you to prove that, not me. Particularly after the events of January 6th. When...  * members of the House give guided tours days before the insurrection  * the Commander in Chief refuses to call the National Guard during a coup attempt, forcing Mike Pence to call in the National Guard instead  * a member of the House (Lauren Boebert) **livetweets** the location of Speaker of the House Pelosi, thereby endangering her life  * when Republicans such as Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz undermine the legitimacy of American democracy by claiming it was an unfair election and that there were irregularities (irregularities that were laughed out of court no less than 60 times, and was not even considered by a Supreme Court that is controlled by a Republican majority)   *  Right after the events of the Capitol Riot, I watched the entire impeachment process on C-Span. One by one Republican after Republican talked about ""how violent"" BLM protesters are, then unequivocally refused to denounce a president who was trying to overthrow a **democratically elected government**. Yes, like the Nazis successfully did way back when. This is a rare case where it is not hyperbolic.   * 197 members of the House refused to denounce clear incitement of his supporters to overthrow a democratically elected government.   I can keep going. When the vast majority of Republicans can't even denounce a straight up coup attempt, *all my points stand*.   So what if there are extremely rare cases where Republicans do care about rule of law and democratic norms that are enshrined in the Constitution? The vast majority of the time, they work to undermine it. The facts overwhelmingly support this argument.

"a couple others from my experience:  1. take however long you need to finish. it took me (and my mom!) eight years and three schools to finish our respective Bachelors’. I had to leave McGill after two years in 2013 and come back home, went to community college for a hot minute, then finished at a UC with my last year being an absolute trainwreck because of my father’s suicide the previous spring. no matter what, you’re getting the same piece of paper from anywhere and like a new car, the value of the name on that paper starts to matter a hell of a lot less as soon as you get it. (ironically, because of tuition hikes here, it cost about the same for California residents to attend UC Santa Cruz in 2014 as I paid at McGill for int’l Arts tuition 2010-2012)  2. HIGH SCHOOL DOES. NOT. DEFINE. YOUR. ACADEMIC. FUTURE. not at all. at Santa Cruz, my best friend in Linguistics had dropped out of high school at 16 with bad grades and got a GED, then transferred to UCSC from community college. he flourished and got a full ride for up to six years to do a PhD at U Chicago (which has a top 5 Ling program in the States), and I’m pretty sure that’s the best anyone in our department’s class that year did. most of my friends were CC transfers. most of us ended up in good grad programs.  just breathe, have a little optimistic nihilist moment about how all this matters less than you think it does in the moment. and to quote Fiona Apple, onward but not toward or away.",Linguistics,BettyCrunker,"12/06/2020, 20:37:54",t3_k7ywzy,gevdf54,Humanities

"To answer your question, I think it is easy to feel like the democratic candidate is superior when the Trump administration set the bar lower than any president has in history.   From their perspective, Democrats have been suffering through   * A president who lost the popular vote by millions and still won because of the electoral college  * A president with a huge problematic history of dealings with Russia and the Ukraine, who encouraged voter manipulation in the 2016 election and had a campaign manager (Paul Manafort) who is now *in jail* and worked for Trump for free while being millions of dollars in debt to Russian oligarchs  * A president who paid $750 dollars taxes in 2016 (this had to be uncovered by the press) and refuses to release his complete tax returns  * A president who has a slew of sexual misconduct allegations that make Bill Clinton's affair with Monika Lewinsky look like a baptism    * A president who refuses to give DNA while one of his victims (E. Jean Carrot) still has a coat with her assaulter's DNA on it  * A president who said there were ""Good people on both sides"" after a rally in Charlottesville that had white supremacists (not even wearing hoods!) openly rioting with tiki torches  * A president who refused to condemn white supremacy *during a presidential debate*, and then said ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by"" referring to a far-right domestic terrorist organization  * A president who separated 500+ children from their parents. This violated human rights acts that America is supposed to champion, along with spitting on international law, as a lot of these migrants had the legal right to request asylum  * A president who has threatened to withdraw from NATO, which weakened international trust in America and alienated crucial allies in the process    * A president with a lawyer (Michel Cohen) who got raided and jailed on 8 counts of financial crimes while working for Donald Trump  * A president with yet another lawyer (Rudy Giuliani) literally saying that there was a 50/50 chance a person he met in the Ukraine was a spy    * A president who has cozied up to dictators and openly admired them  * A president who has openly stated that he believes Putin over intelligence from the US intelligence community *while at a press conference*  * A president who has refused to wear face masks, and had downplayed Covid-19 when it emerged. America has the highest per-capita death toll in the world.       * A president who dismantled the vast majority of the pandemic task force administration that was created in order to handle epidemics like ebola  washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/20/was-white-house-office-global-pandemics-eliminated/    * A president who has openly proclaimed that he will not peacefully transfer power. This is unprecedented in American history.   * A president who refuses to concede an election, and has sued several states to attempt to prevent further ballot counting  **Disregard climate change for a moment and look at that list. There's a reason that democrats see the people they support as superior. It's because there isn't a bar that could get lower.**  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  **Finally, the idea that playing nice with Republicans is strategically a good thing is also flawed.** Obama attempted to work with Republicans, and he lost a Supreme Court seat due to a precedent Mitch McConnell set, then refused to honor for his own party, unfairly netting the Republicans two seats. This is something that Mitch McConnell himself regards as one of his greatest moments:     **A lot of Republicans see kindness as a weakness, and will exploit it at every opportunity to win. Trying to work across the aisle is seen as weakness and is exploited as much as possible.**  EDIT: If you want to understand a bit more of what I mean, please give this video a watch. It's long but it has well developed arguments.   That's the reason that strong man politics work on that group of people--the very thing that Conservatives complain about is the same thing that they listen to. Conservatives complain about democrats telling them their points are stupid because incredulity and a refusal to normalize this behavior is kryptonite for them.   When conservatives say ""Democrats are being mean to us"" they are essentially using that as the argument rather than addressing the fact that their ideas are baloney.  **If someone has willingness to start a discussion in a respectful fashion without arguing in bad faith, all of your points stand.

"You're getting downvoted because there isn't ""a lesson to be learned"" here.

Go to pretty much any Polisci prof at McGill (people who study politics & political institutions for a living) and they'll agree with me, because there is an objective truth here--that Trump cannot and should not be placed on the same pedestal as Biden.

">My whole point is, that there is no objective right or wrong, it is how we look at it.  This is a problematic assertion. You can't say the moon is made of cheese or that the Earth is flat. There are objective facts, and there are some facts that should not be seen as things that should be given equal weight or treated with respect. The same goes for moral arguments. There are some things that are just immoral, like an administration locking 500+ children of asylum seekers in cages.   There should be no whataboutism when it comes to an administration that refuses to condemn white supremacy. If you think that is not an objective moral fact, that's problematic.   >Let’s say you consider them disgusting and then insult them and consider yourself superior, these leads to discrimination against one side. People start feelong marginalized and act more violent than they would have otherwise.  I'm not saying Trump supporters should be treated with unnecessary cruelty. I'm saying that in light of all the odious, objective facts we know, it is not beneficial to American democracy to pretend that there are two sides that have equal value, because one side is at this point supporting fascism.

"If the best argument in favor of someone's political views is that the other side is dismissive, obnoxious, or mean, then that person probably does not have the facts on their side.   If liberals based their political arguments on the notion that conservatives or Trump supporters have been mean to them, they would be laughed out of politics.   The notion that the extreme far-right views of conservatives and Trump supporters are the fault of mean liberals is a laughable excuse for believing things which are not based on facts and sound argumentation.     The other thing is that people who right do not hold themselves to the same standard. You have people like Ben Shapiro telling liberals that ""facts don't care about their feelings, sweaty,"" and right-wingers who literally are in support of fascism. People should not be encouraged to normalize fascism by treating fascists as belonging to different sides of the same coin. Full stop.   Why should liberals be held to a far higher standard while tiki-torch wielding Trump supporters go to Charlottesville chanting ""They will not replace us"" and then their white supremacy is LITERALLY ENDORSED by a sitting president?   Finally, I've got to point out that Trump has never won the popular vote. Just because a good chunk of the country is uneducated on fascism and hate people who are educated does not mean that they should be coddled for supporting a fascist.   Fascists do not change their mind unless they are shamed into doing so. The lesson to learn here is that Trump was the culmination of the Southern strategy.

If the university truly cared about empowering students, they’d give students a choice.  The issue that comes up here is that of assessments. A big reason for return to in-person is the ability to have in-person exams (even if you have to scatter them through a full month to keep distances). Having in-person exams would allow profs to structure courses in a way that would be a LOT more enjoyable for students even if those courses are mostly remote. Having an option to be fully remote means that you can't possibly have in-person exams and that defeats a lot of the point of returning to in-person at least from an academic perspective.

"I thought I knew what I was getting into when I decided to come to McGill. I was wrong. I liken it to looking both ways before you cross the street, and then getting hit by an airplane.  My mental health was incredibly rough in first year. I had to seek help from Student Health, and I ended up seeing a psychiatrist a number of times.  I'm in second year now. My mental health is wayyyyy better, I don't see a psychiatrist anymore, and I feel like I've finally got my feet back under me and I'm ready to climb the mountain. Choosing McGill was hard, but I still think it was the right choice. I would not trade the friends and memories I've made and the things I've learned for anything, and I've only been here for a year.  I wish I had known a couple things before I came. First is that the campus vibe, at least in my experience, is WAY different than I expected (I was picturing a Guelph or Western or Queen's type beat). My experience is that you have to seek out your social life a little bit more, and that most of the social events involve ""going out"" in some form. The drinking age is a plus if you know how to drink responsibly, but the weed age just got raised (goddamn CAQ).  Second, you might hear people say that McGill is a hard school, which has not been my experience here. I'd say that the most challenging aspect of it is the self discipline, which I sucked at. If you can stay on top of your work, and figure out what isn't working when something isn't going right, the marks should come (at least at the beginning). I had negative time management skills, severe mental health problems, and a kidney stone two days before an exam last year, and I still pulled out a 3.2 in my first year. That being said, I know I can do WAY better than that and I'm trying hard to improve my habits this year.  My time at McGill has been a rollercoaster, but I think I'm getting the hang of it now. If you do decide to come here, just come in expecting the unexpected and realize that no matter how hard you mentally prepare, things are not going to go as planned. C'est la vie!

"This is just a ploy by McGill to keep collecting tuition from international students.  Currently, many are outside the country and they contribute the highest amount to tuition revenue. By switching to online-first, these students will not feel left out and are less likely to consider deferring their term.  If McGill really wants to prove that they are doing this for corona, they should acknowledge that online learning provides a lesser experience that could easily be found on platforms like Coursera and should thus charge a tuition that reflects that.",Software Engineering,Rainmaker0909,"05/14/2020, 06:05:12",t3_gj68k7,fqku3au,Math Sciences

"Here’s their 2019 audit:   And here’s their budget book:   McGill currently spend 35M$/year on library services and another 28M$/year on institutions services. There are plenty of places where operational costs can be reduced while still enabling maintenance for continuation. You are right about tuition revenue representing a large portion. In fact, it’s 350M out of 1.4Bn.  I appreciate you understanding that this is a free market and that I can go to coursera. Unfortunately, my ancestor’s 50% marginal tax rate has already invested in McGill and the reason for doing so is the product offered by McGill provides superior education to tolls like coursera. However when you remove physical office hours, have profs who can’t figure out how to do online saying they’re too shy to speak in a virtual lecture, remove access to labs, libraries and services then the educational product loses much of its value.  I’m not saying that moving to virtual is a bad move. I absolutely agree that it must be done to preserve healthcare, but I am stating that McGill may have ulterior motives based on their current financial data and if they’re really doing so for the sake of society they would take measures on tuition to reflect so.",Software Engineering,Rainmaker0909,"05/15/2020, 02:13:51",t3_gj68k7,fqo6y30,Math Sciences

On the other end, as a course instructor but also in student services while a PhD candidate, I've received multiple cuts in contracts and I'm not sure how many more cuts will be done (at least in my faculty as well as the departments that I work in) that pretty much reduces availability of university jobs where they are also students. It's complex I find...

However, the sanctions taken against Professor B were questionable, in Saideman’s view.  >[...]  > As a sanction, Saideman wrote on his blog post, “he [Professor B] got moved out of his office in a remote location and put next to my office. I apparently was supposed to babysit/ monitor him (which was strange since I only learned of his behavior informally, not through the administration).” Moreover, Professor B was conditionally restricted from taking on graduate students following the investigation, but Saideman notes that “his ban of supervising grad students apparently has lapsed as well,” and it appears as though Professor B has taken on new female graduate students since the investigation.

Not everyone has the privilege to go to university or even have these University talks at the dinner table. To be enrolled at a university is a privilege and remember that there are people from all kinds of backgrounds at McGill. I rarely open up to people but I am a first-generation student. Navigating this university life isn't easy, feels alienating, and finding the right resources is hard. I remembered once, I told someone that my parents are housekeepers and that I don't have data because I'm poor (I still don't) and the person gave me weird snobby looks.  The point is, I am proud that my immigrant parents are housekeepers (just how you're proud of your grandparents and parents). They've worked hard, made sacrifices, and managed to be successful despite people/society looking down at them. I just wished some McGillians would stop being snobs for once, stop looking at classism, see everyone as human and realized that we're all successful people in different ways.

"Okay so lots goes into making a house, and houses (especially for my family) are tied to a lot of debt. The house (the one we - as in my Grandma’s sibling, not my grandma herself - still own) has been mortgaged several times, we don’t own it outright. Loans were taken to afford the materials, etc. That said, the combined income of 11 people and their spouses, all working several jobs, went into this house. We didn’t just magically have the money, and yes we were poor and are still barely above the poverty line despite owning a large house. You also need to take into consideration how many people lived/live in these houses. There’s 4 different families and 4 generations living in the current house. Not that it’s a competition, but I’m not sure what part of owning a house means that my family is automatically better off than yours. The point of my post is that my family is poor and uneducated, yet smart and resourceful, and they have their own unique accomplishments, *that’s* why we have a home worth millions.  Also, I have an inheritance because my dad died in a car accident... not because he had money left over to gift me. It was an insurance payout. He had nothing. I’m not exactly sure why you found the need to analyze my story and turn this into a debate/an effort to gatekeep poverty. There was no need. Regardless, I know what I am and where I am on the poverty line, I don’t really think I need your help figuring that out.   > did someone say something disrespectful   Yes.

"This is the downside of the department system where departments have to deliver freshman courses to everyone. Even though the students are not math majors, the profs are math profs/lecturers who usually teach math courses and develop habits that are not compatible with faculty-wide freshman courses.  There are current issues with courses like MATH 323 and MATH 240 because they are taught by math profs to CS students and it ends up being absurdly hard some semesters when the instructors go all in.  If McGill cared about the problem they should hire Faculty lecturers (who actually answer to the faculty) for freshman courses who would basically be more like Pavelka and only focus on large undergraduate courses. The current system isn't fair anyway, with the CHEM and MATH departments having to provide extremely large courses for students of other departments. Those departments shouldn't have to foot the administrative bill of the freshman program, and a part of this kind of stuff we see is math professors pushing back against having to teach a bunch of freshmen with limited interest for math (with I think is somewhat understandable for both sides although this exam is clearly too extreme).

"What I think would have been a good solution is to have a large portion of the exam as practice exams delivered to us days in advance and have the remainder as the real exam. The questions were shocking because they were in an unfamiliar style, which I'm sure they had no choice for. But even so, if we had seen it before and prepared for it, it would have been much better.

You could fail the exam and still get 55% in the course. The WebWork assignments were already a free 20%. The midterm exam was worth 30%.

"I agree that the exam being designed for three hours was an absolute lie. It was more like 8 - 16 hours. By that, the exam was definitely unfair. But everything else about the exam was pretty fair. Everyone keeps complaining about the problems but no one has come up with a better solution for the problems. No one has thought in the perspective of the professors who are giving the problems. I keep repeating that there was no choice that they had to give such problems. Also, what's wrong with a class average of B? Isn't that a fair average? Why should the class average be an A? I'm not buying that ""because this is a pandemic"" as a valid reason at all. That's why the S/U option exists. I'm not sure if the class average will be a B, by the way -- just an educated guess.

"I agree that the length of the exam was a big issue. But I think it was the only issue. The problems are not an issue. If there were 5 problems instead of 15, I think the class average would be higher and that it would actually take 3 - 6 hours. Before you disagree that the problems are not an issue, please provide a better solution for the problems yourself. No one has done this so I am not convinced. I still disagree about the A class average. There is no good reason for this when the S/U option already exists. Like I said, I'm not buying ""because this is a pandemic"" because that's simply not a valid reason at all. People who perform poorly because of the pandemic should take the S/U.

"No worries. And I'm sorry to hear about your situation. That really does sound awful. I agree that in your case, and probably in many other students' cases, this exam sounds terribly unfair, especially those who actually worked hard. I think this exam is unfair for its length. Please don't make me repeat this. Let's get that out of the way now.  I agree that the problems given to us are very different in approach than the traditional problems (which are textbook problems). They were proof-based problems. We have never or rarely ever approached proof-based problems in class. There were only a few proof-based problems in the textbook. Proof-based problems are problems that require a lot of intuition over practice. This is why they are hard for so many students. Even I find it much harder than computation problems. I'm with you there.  What I've been saying is that there was no choice for this. There had to be proof-based problems. Because if the problems were to be like the textbook problems or the in-class problems, people would cheat their way with a calculator to get 100%, not actually doing the exam. This probably isn't what you mean or what you want, right? I'm willing to hear a different approach for the style of problems. What kind of problems do you think would have been suitable for this exam? Please be specific if possible.  I like responses like yours just now. Whenever I try to justify anything opposite to what the crowd thinks without being mean-spirited or callous, people will point fingers at me, saying I lack compassion, saying I'm condescending, and saying I'm privileged. These need to stop, please. I really only want to have a healthy discussion about this. And if things really go south, we can simply agree to disagree! There's nothing wrong with that. But my mind is subject to change if I hear a convincing argument. Almost no one wants to reason with me and only want to point fingers at me. This has been making me a bit upset. Thank you for not doing that just now. I appreciate it.",Samosa Resurrector,soapyarm,"04/24/2020, 18:17:53",t3_g6rxcf,foggh20,UNKNOWN

I definitely feel that Asians are the victims of political hysteria and have replaced Muslims as the bete noir du jour :(   politicians played with fire for cheap political points by calling it China virus... Just last week I saw posters saying China lied people died and calling out the CCP etc. I don't want to be alarmist, but before the Quebec city shooting I'd have also said such a thing is impossible in Canada. Unfortunately, it isn't... The case of Islamophobia in the wake of the war on terror shows that such political stuff has repercussions within western countries too.

"We've kinda had a similar discussion in [another thread]( though it was more bilingual-ish. For now, I'll keep this thread up in case anglophones didn't read the last thread :P  I read the article and agree with the main message. However, I do feel that the LaPresse article does lead readers down the route of sweeping statements that paint the whole student body with a broad brush. Samuel Veissière states that this is a ""generational problem"" and I don't like that idea. His statement ""La montée de cette culture est liée à une génération d’enfants-rois/the rise of this culture is linked with a generation of child kings,"" overgeneralizes the situation and annoys me.   That being said, I absolutely agree (and have previously noted) with the statement that the use of trigger warnings can easily become problematic for the mental health of the very people [trigger warnings are supposed to protect]( There's scant empirical evidence that supports the use of trigger warnings. If someone has evidence that supports the use of trigger warnings, I'd be happy to give it a read.   With that being said, I wouldn't throw out the baby with the bathwater. We can't disqualify everything left-wing/'woke' based on the frankly idiotic actions of one student, or the idiotic actions of McGill's administration. Not saying that you are doing that, but I've noticed that sometimes people use examples like this to excoriate students who happen to be left-wing, rather than filtering out the baloney.   I just hope that McGill's administration wisens up in cases where the student is simply in the wrong, such as in this case.

In most cases it’s a victimless crime, like bumping all 84.5s up to 85s, or considering an alternate grading scheme to help pass a student.   Things like extra credit or individual assignments are bigger issues, since they tend to unfairly benefit the more vocal students. Even then, it’s hard to enforce, since the student with the bonus won’t report it.",Mech Eng,BiggerD,"04/20/2021, 00:33:49",t3_mudqi9,gv5bzv0,UNKNOWN

"I think barring students from registering would be pretty harsh. Right now, the government’s goal is to have everyone fully vaccinated by mid-late September, a bit after the add-drop deadline.   It seems likely we’ll have a lot of students with one vaccine on the first day of school, who are fully vaccinated by the end of September. But if we’re banning these students from even enrolling, then they can’t follow along online for any remote courses, or follow along a textbook. If they’re not fully vaccinated by Sept 15 and don’t register, they’ll have to miss the entire Fall semester.   I’ve also had to submit proof of vaccination for school in the US, but it was really easy to stop by any pharmacy to get a tetanus shot. I want the vaccine right now but can’t get fully vaccinated for several months, and don’t see why I should be forced to miss an entire semester because of that.",Mech Eng,BiggerD,"04/21/2021, 12:53:20",t3_muu9sv,gvbgpcn,UNKNOWN
"> I personally think classes 150+ will be allowed.  Are you a McGill student? I see in your post history that you post on many different university subreddits. McGill has very few rooms that can fit 150+ students. Even without social distancing, scheduling big classes is a nightmare, so any form of social distancing added to these constraints makes it difficult to have these classes in person, even in good scenarios.

"I saw a cute girl at the cafeteria in RVC yesterday. I told her how cool it was to meet her, but I didn’t want to be a creep and bother her and ask her for her number or anything. She said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but she kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my food ordering, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen samosas in her hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Ma'am, you need to pay for those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When the cashier took one of the samosas and started scanning it multiple times, she stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each samosa and put them in a bag and started to say the price, she kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",Engineering,MobilizeEngage,"11/17/2020, 19:02:03",t3_jvynkn,gcmzsj6,UNKNOWN

"> As a Muslim, the lack of truth behind what you are saying is nauseating. I made a post trying to raise awareness for what Muslims were experiencing in China and it was promptly removed by moderators when all I asked was those who support the oppressed gather in a show of support/protest. Instead of writing a novel of BS, you could’ve been more truthful by just saying when you agree with the topic or when it’s convenient for you. All of the above reasons are the opposite reasons for why my post asking people to show solidarity with those in concentration camps was removed. Your exact words say it’s okay to foster a political debate yet when China is mistreating Muslims you remove the post, but when it’s Israel the oppression of Muslims matters. Got it.

We do not approve or disapprove posts based on whether we agree with the topic, and honestly I don't think it would make sense for anyone to be biased towards Palestine and biased against Uyghurs, I have never ever met someone with that set of positions, and that's certainly not the case of the McGill Daily.

"I can't help but feel an ego thing in this. SSMU feels they weren't consulted enough for the project, so they're against it. It's just hard for me to see a reaction this strong being rational, the project presented by mcgill is pretty balanced.  Has McGill admin done a stellar job of running the school in the last 2 years? No, definitely definitely not. They should definitely be criticized for the stuff they mess up.  Should McGill have consulted students more in the process? I don't know the details but yeah, probably.  Is attempting to attach this issue to covid management and investments in fossil fuels a strong argument against New Vic? No, it really, really isn't. If there is something profundly wrong with this project it should stand on its own.  Do research labs, a library, and classrooms sound like something McGill and its student do need right now? It really does fit a direct need that will directly improve the quality of life of students.  Why does SSMU have to take such a hard stance here? There's still room on the site to do other stuff. We need classrooms, labs and library space anyway. Royal Vic has been associated to McGill pretty closely for well over 100 years and McGill could have very well ended up owning this space a long time ago. It's not like McGill is building on  parc Jeanne-Mance.  Why can't SSMU point out the lack of communication and transparency on the side of McGill (which appear to be present and worth criticizing) while adopting a minimally measured position and recognizing ANY of the positive sides of the project? Do they not realize that going all out against everything that they don't fully agree with is not the best way to convince people that they could play an important, constructive role as an interlocutor to McGill in the design of a project of this scale. And by people here, I mean both McGill admin, governments, and the students they represent.   McGill should strive for more transparency and exchange with students. God knows they fucked up on a lot of stuff in recent years. But this specific project actually includes a lot of stuff that the student body actually wants: space for students, more research and learning opportunities (especially centered around sustainability) more focus on sustainability in general, etc. Presenting this as some universally terrible, major fuckup from a dictatorial McGill admin is just not intellectually honest, and it's not a position that correctly represents the student body..

Does SSMU realize that the university needs more space to grow and thrive or is their goal just to complain? Long-term sustainability requires more space. Do they really think it is in anyone's benefit to have a debate in the National Assembly with the CAQ in power about what should happen to the site?

"I've been following this project since I moved to Montreal and I definitely agree with OP. There has been consultation. And from what I remember, the gov't had to be convinced to give some of the property to McGill -- and there were legitimate fears about what would happen to the space. Like it or not, it's a ton of real estate that needs extensive rennovation, and the main building also has heritage status, and comes with the complications that that entails. The best, and most public minded thing the city can do is to give it to McGill, and now there's the funding to turn it into something usable. And literally anything is better than condos, if there wasn't a push to deed the land to McGill, you can bet there'd be a condo project, historical status or not.",rats rats rats,kotopii,"09/22/2021, 12:10:15",t3_psxih6,hdu2ghr,UNKNOWN

"It sure seems to me like this group of students is upset that the University management is in charge of managing. They call the planning committees obscure, just because they were not involved. It's almost like the university actually chose experienced and qualified individuals to plan this project, not a bunch of unqualified active students with half baked rainbow sunshine ideas. The SSMU is still a group of students. Students do learning, management does managing, it's just that simple. If you want to be involved, get a management degree, get experience in the industry, then come back once your in a position to say things worthwhile. The whole email sounded like a bunch of spoiled brats upset that they didn't get a seat at the big boy table working on the biggest, shiniest project right now.  One thing that really bothers me in the email is how they put the fossil fuel investments and COVID management as a footnote. Things that are more of an issue, that they protested heavily about for a little while, are now relegated to footnote mentions despite little having changed. It shows me that whether they care somewhat about the cause, what is most important for them is to enjoy the feeling of rebellion and protest against 'The Man', moving from hot topic to hot topic like fast fashion. It disgusts me. If an issue matters to us, stick with it until something is done. That is how change can be affected.  As a whole, it seems at times as though the SSMU simply despises the university it exists under. If these students are so upset with McGill's very existence then why do they go here. Sure they make a big fuss, protesting anything and everything about it while here, but these people will all benefit from a McGill degree in the end. They are reaping the benefits while trashing what gives them those very benefits.",Bioengineering,McGillMaster,"09/27/2021, 14:49:39",t3_psxih6,heh74ea,Life Sciences

"But this letter is supposed to be about McGill's lack of consultation with how it's developed its plans for the use of the site, and the older letter is about the government of Quebec's lack of consultation in giving the land to McGill. That's not the same consultation; that's not the same organization. François Legault and Big Suze aren't the same person.  And fundamentally the complaint, despite saying that McGill's development contributes to the public good, seems to contradict itself in implying that if McGill is using the land it cannot be dedicated to the public good, which seems strange to me, as the university is publicly funded and meant to provide a public good. The header of the letter calls for people to reject the privatization of and condominium development at the Royal Vic site. But then the connection to McGill seems to be then that McGill could one day, after building and presumably using this plot of land as campus space, sell it to a real estate developer to be converted into a luxury housing development. That seems a little tenuous.  Could the consultation by Quebec have been more comprehensive? Sure, probably. Could McGill's? Again, probably. But it's two different bodies having separate consultations along two stages through the greater part of a decade relating to McGill receiving and developing less than one fifth of the plot for the hospital long attached to McGill's campus.","novus alumnus, quasi vetus",BeckoningVoice,"09/22/2021, 03:22:30",t3_psxih6,hdswx1f,UNKNOWN

"It's their choice to break the law.

If you need something during your 14 day quarantine, there are phone numbers you can call to get items delivered to your door. There's no excuse.

Basically, they’re catering to the biggest demographic (undergrads who want to go to class) without listening to the people who have to make that happen and who also simultaneously are at risk.   The faculty and TAs actually seemed interested in integrating in-person teaching for fall 2021! They are intensely aware that students are miserable and suffering. There would be enough time and resources and hopefully even a portion of participants vaccinated by then for it to work. But it is now essentially November, and they are asking for in person teaching to be ready to go for January 4.

"The high school and elementary school model is different then the university model. Grade schools are able to bubble and have one teacher to one class, or one classroom where teachers rotate.

There's no way to do something like this in university for undergrads, even those in the same department have vastly different schedules. There's no way to bubble. If you can't bubble, you can't compare it to K-12.  Also if I have to guess, albatrossalex is using we because they were in the same meeting I was yesterday and the TAs/profs are pretty united in these statements. A good portion of the meeting was trying to figure out if/how the bio department could opt out of being in-person.

I mentioned in another comment but yes you’re right, this is the university listening to those paying for its services - arguably this is maybe a first for McGill. And again, the reaction would have been much more favourable if the in-person semester was Fall 2021, where people will be potentially be vaccinated and McGill has time to implement new safety measures. For January, they have November and half of December to figure it out, which is harsh and unrealistic.   About the returning to work thing, I think it’s because professors at universities consider themselves less “essential”. University isn’t mandatory, so I think they were collectively relieved that only elementary and high schools up to grade 10 had to go back to work. I think they feel a bit targeted now that they’re being told, rather than asked, to go to work.   And my apologies for offending you with the plague comment.

"I hear you, but I also haven't bought a sandwich from a sandwich shop since Feb even through an app. I don't think you should have been forced to work then either. You can't assume the profs and TA's aren't thinking of the undergrads' health as well. Other universities around the globe have rolled out in person teaching with more resources, testing, and rules than McGill and its been a dismal failure.  Part of the problem is the mismatch between what the admin is telling us we're allowed to do research wise and what we're supposed to do teaching wise. They're saying it isn't safe for 2 people to be outdoors collecting samples together, it isn't safe for 2 people to be in the same lab at the same time even if they bubble or social distance, it isn't safe for one person to be alone in a room by themselves only working on a computer. This has had severe effects on research -- which brings in millions of dollars via grants and is directly related to the academic progress of grad students. Now we still can't do all of that but now teaching a room or lab full of undergrads is ok?  Like it or not McGill is a research university. Teaching undergrads isn't the only job profs and grad students have. We all want nothing more than to go back to normal and get back on campus (online teaching sucks as much as online learning) but the health and safety guidelines aren't there. Even if McGill loses some undergrad tuition, they're not exactly on the verge of financial ruin. The profs and their grad students bring in more than tuition via grant money in some departments... so demanding profs just suck it up and get back to teaching when it isn't actually necessary sounds like entitlement from this end, too.

"People in this thread are saying what mcgill should do, etc—but they won't apologize, this is admin! They should immediately move exams online for courses that have been online all semester. If they really want to hold all these exams in person, they should give up on the concept of distancing, have multiple entrances for students, and tell people to come at least 30 min early (sounds like y'all were waiting for more than that, and I'm so sorry that happened). Of course, if vaccination had already been mandatory and the school had that info on file in minerva or something, maybe a lot of the covid theatre that made everyone wait outside could be avoided.  What they should have done, and should do if they actually want to have this be fair to students, is **not start the exams until 80-90% of people are in there.** Does that mean that exams will start at 940, 240? Yeah. But tough shit, that's what it's like with covid right now. The fact that admin doesn't want to acknowledge the realities and did this is incredibly unfair.

What was particularly egregious was the fact that Math 140 looked mostly like U0/U1 students—experiences vary, of course, but the students in my rows looked caught off guard by how to use the answer sheets, bubble stuff in, didn't know to bring pencils, and were extremely stressed by how chaotic this morning was. And that's valid! Because it was the FIRST in-person exam McGill has done in 2 years, and they chose to make U0/U1 students into guinea pigs for something that fell apart almost immediately. Some students were on the verge of tears when they found out the exam started at 910 (when they arrived at 940), and frankly if it had been me, I would have been as well.   McGill admin failed from top to bottom bc I as an invigilator wasn't prepared to answer the questions asked of me (I wanted to, believe me—everyone deserved the 3 hours they were told they were gonna get) and students today were disrespected. Exams are tough enough without an admin that operates under a sense of delusion near constantly. I hope the next few days/weeks will be better, but if admin doesn't do anything, it honestly won't be. Come to your exams with a full water bottle, start your exam, and go to the bathroom once it starts if you need to, ask your invigilators questions about protocol, and leave early for exams if the lines continue like this. If you have other official outlets to complain, I highly recommend doing that as well.",English,fluffy_seaotter,"12/08/2021, 01:46:59",t3_rb084d,hno0tyr,Humanities

My friend was in a class that had a covid-19 positive recently as well...

"FWIW, McGill is tough both academically and mentally. I met with an alumnus 2 days ago who is now a Prof at Yale and she said that McGill really prepares you for the real world in the sense that the world doesn't care about you and you have to take care of yourself and go out of your way to get what you want. In that sense, you are more matured and independent than you’d think. (True story, the prof was approached by a Dean of students to cater to some girl who wants to defer an exam because she happens to be traveling somewhere for 2 weeks during the duration of the exam). The alumnus told me that Harvard and Yale students are a lot more entitled and catered to than those at McGill. With that said, we all know McGill could do better, especially on mental health services and other areas. As much as we love to complain about McGill, rest assured that we will graduate and come out stronger and more resilient.

"I must admit that this is a great way to frame the problem with current education. The feeling that the material was extremely unengaging in entry level classes is something I can agree with; however, I can't help but get a feeling that you're in favor of a more elitist idea of higher education instead of having it open to more people just so your degree has more value.   As the technical needs of a society in its aggregate grows, should we not also expect the training of its constituency to increase as well? The crowding out effect is natural and in fact, I believe that it should be encouraged. The pool is indeed getting shallower. The value of your degree is in the scarcity of the owners. But what we should be paying attention to is that while the original pool was getting smaller, a new pool was dug.  There used to be a time when getting into high school was a massive achievement unfathomable to most. Then it became standard, and the new carrot on the stick became entering university. Now it's become an expectation to have a university degree. But that's not the end. Why don't we talk about Masters? What about PhDs?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I see your argument on the appeal of experiences outside of academia with regards to getting a job to be the same as the thought process behind ""how will I, someone with a high school terminal degree, distinguish myself from other high school alumni when searching for a job, since I'm not willing (or am not smart enough) to be a university grad competing against a high school alumnus?""

"I had to deal with this mentality throughout nursing courses in CEGEP. Some teachers would just say the average on nursing exams is always low, that's the way it is. An average of 60 something percent on the first exam of 3rd year is normal. To me, it didn't make sense. Don't we want people to be good nurses? Don't we want to see, over time, an increase in the grades? If the average is so low, what is it the students aren't understanding? There has to be an issue with the transmission of information, no?

"I hear you but I ultimately disagree. In my experience, those kinds of professors are not bad at conveying information, but rather design their assignments and exams to be much more difficult/convoluted than the level at which they teach the material. While I don't think this should be done for every class, having a handful of these hardcore classes interspersed throughout your bachelor's is quite beneficial imo.  These are the classes that make you grow and appreciate the intricacy of your field of study the most. Sure, it's not an enjoyable experience when you're in the thick of it. However, as a student at one of the world's top 50 universities, you're not paying for an enjoyable experience, you're paying for a top-tier education. Part of that is being confronted to difficulty and learning how to handle the stress, self-questioning, and occasional disappointment that comes with it.  Of course there are some caveats to these claims. For example, making an introductory course very difficult goes against the very purpose of the course by discouraging many potentially gifted students by challenging them too much too early.",Physics,French2Pac,"07/15/2020, 17:32:47",t3_hrjl6a,fy5xlpw,UNKNOWN
"I'm going to do my very best not to sound like a cursed boomer here but I'm sure this will still get downvoted to oblivion: I think OP's point is childish and indicative of a defeatist mindset. As someone who has had term GPA's ranging from 2.5-4 I've had this mindset before. I've been in classes where the prof has told me (to my face) and others to drop the class. If a prof tells you the material will be difficult, then view it as a challenge, because daunting as it may seem, an undergraduate class in any subject is never ""impossible"" for a student who is smart and mature enough. There's no shame in finishing with a bad grade as long as you tried your hardest. It may be that the class was in fact too hard for you (yes, such a think exists). That's not an intrinsic problem with the class or prof but instead a manifestation of the simple fact that only a small proportion of people are cut out for some things, and theres a chance you're not one of those people.   While a professor who cares about you is a wonderful thing to be cherished (s/o Pichot gang), a professor who doesn't isn't an ""entitled fuck."" They are a person who knows more about a very narrow subject than 99.999% of people on the earth and they are being asked to provide you with very basic information that you are meant to digest and internalize. Your inability to do so as a student doesn't reflect on the profs apparent unwillingness to hold your hand through the process. No matter how difficult the class, there are always kids who do well - because they are exemplary students who by definition will succeed irrespective of the quality of the teacher. If you are not one such student then that's ok, just don't expect a 4.0 GPA. I've fully accepted that I'm not a 4.0 student, and that's ok just as long as I do my best. If I fail math 576 this fall then I will have done so because I am not good enough at topology, not because Dani Wise is a big bad evil man - even though I know that the first thing he'll say in the first lecture is that many of us will be dropping the class.

"I disagree, the prof clearly cares deeply about student success and the class average is consistently a B+ for PHYS 101, and a B for PHYS 131. He does not brag about it being a difficult class, and actually is outspoken about it being a class with many resources (FrezCa, his lectures, TEAM mentors, the textbook, CAPA, clicker questions, etc) for success. He is also a passionate educator and explains concepts clearly. He provides many past exams to study from, and reuses questions from them and in class clickers. On top of all that, he scales grades generously at the end of the semester.

"I don't think he's proud that the averages are low. They just happen to be low because they're challenging exams, I didn't do fantastic on them and some of the things you have to assume are weird but overall they're not unreasonable. I think if a class happened to get a high average on one, he would actually be very happy and proud of his students. He is very clear from the beginning of the class that the exam questions are similar to the CAPA challenge questions, but that's because he wants students to go beyond simply memorizing how to do a question, and instead actually understand the material - nothing is out of the scope of the course in my opinion. Sure, I'd love if he gave harder normal CAPA questions to prepare us, but people would no doubt complain about that too. Literally at least one or two questions on each exam is a direct rip off of a CAPA challenge, people are just chapped because those specific problems aren't required homework.   He also gives tons of opportunities to get help and succeed like bonus marks, FrezCa, office hours, questions after class, ect, and scales grades when necessary because he understands that getting shit mark for a class you understand isn't gonna help anyone.  I just feel like its unfair to say that just because he's a classic physics professor who shits on life science and engineering as a joke, doesn't mean that he doesn't care about his students or is dismissive of their success. Obviously he knows theres a lot of hopeful future med students because it's a class for mostly life science students (PHYS 101) and a lot of biology undergrads hope to do medicine one day. I feel like those comments aren't about his class but more about how many people go into their undergrad thinking they want to go to med school before they see the vast amount of career options in STEM.",Earth Systems and Procrastination,canoegay,"07/16/2020, 04:58:12",t3_hrjl6a,fy822tr,UNKNOWN

"I definitely agree with you on points 1-8 (I could maybe quibble some of the wording, but I'm on board with the general idea of all of them).   On the other hand, we might not see eye to eye on the following two points:  * I think it would still be beneficial to have one of these hard classes be mandatory for most majors (I would say all, but I'm sure there are reasonable boundary cases that I'm not considering).  Pretty much everyone would benefit from being challenged at this level during their education.  By 'hard', I mean that only a minute portion of enrolled students get an A/A-; not 'impossible to pass'.  * Not doing well in a class related to a topic that one is already familiar with and that one enjoys shouldn't discourage anyone from pursuing their studies on that subject as a whole. If it does, then one should question why they enjoy studying this topic in the first place.  I know this second point sounds heartless, but I'll elaborate on why it's important. IME, many in their undergrad (myself included, to a certain extent) aren't fully sure what they want to do with their lives and don't really have a strong reason behind their choice of major beyond general interest (which is fine). One reason people enjoy studying a given subject is because they are successful in doing so (i.e. they get good grades) and thus have a positive reinforcement loop that keeps them engaged.   However, if they lose their passion for the subject upon receiving a low mark, then maybe being good at that subject was the only real reason for their interest in it. In that case, being awoken to that fact early in their life spares them from being disillusioned further down the road, when they'll have made certain life choices (e.g. applying to grad school) with the underlying assumption that they are truly passionate about said subject.  I also want to add that realising that one isn't ~passionate~ about a field of study doesn't mean they should switch majors or drop out; most graduates get jobs that have very little to do with what they studided during their bachelor's degree. This realisation should just help them orient themselves towards the career path that is most fulfilling for them.",Physics,French2Pac,"07/15/2020, 18:42:24",t3_hrjl6a,fy66jlp,UNKNOWN
"This is complete BS. I've been a TEAM mentor for PHYS 101/131 for the past 3 years and Ragan has shown time and time again how much he cares about teaching and improving his methods for educating students. In fact, I can say from experience that Ragan is one of the few profs I've had who actually seems to enjoy teaching, much more than many of the upper year life sci profs who mostly just teach so they can get back to their research. With Ragan's experience at McGill, he doesn't have to teach one of the largest freshman classes of he doesn't want to. He CHOOSES to teach it and tries to make the physics in the course as accessible as possible.  Phys 101 can be a challenging course, but its not impossible to do well. There are so many resources for students and there's no-one to blame but yourself for not doing well (phys 131 is another story but thats to prep people for more physics and maths intensive degrees).  Ragan doesn't have a dismissive attitude towards students with med school dreams. If you can't make it through phys101, then you're probably not gonna make it though the rest of your upper year courses with an average thats competitive for med.

"No, don't back down on this. Spanish Flu didn't originate in Spain. The nickname simply developed naturally as most news of the virus was coming out of Spain, since most of the rest of the world was a little preoccupied with the war effort. ""China virus,"" conversely, didn't come about naturally; it's an attempt by Trump to force a nickname and assign blame on China.   The name that most sane people use, and the name that has become naturally commonplace, is Coronavirus or Covid-19. There's no reason to go out of your way to call it anything else unless you're trying to push a narrative.

"SSRIs are not a magic bullet.   They take at least a month to work and the dosage needs to be increased over time, and the patient might need to discontinue treatment due to side effects.   In my experience, I took one antidepressant which made me bitchy and irritable and a terror to be around. I was on it for 6 months.   Then I switched to a second antidepressant, which made me almost normal except for the fact that I couldn't...reach the top of the mountain, if you know what I mean. That took around 6 months to get off of, because I was having to weigh having a sex life or being depressed.   I chose option C, as in, try a third antidepressant, which was actually an SNRI. That one worked better than the other two, but it's expensive. It costs $127 a month with RAMQ, and I'm still dealing with bouts of severe depression.   This is an example of the kind of shit people with depression have to deal with. It's not as easy as that.   I exercise regularly, I eat three meals a day (or two, whatever I'm still a student), and I take antidepressants. I'm still depressed. I hope to *god* that you aren't in psych, because if you think it's that easy to deal with depression, you are misinformed.",German Studies & PoliSci Nut,Razwog,"12/03/2020, 08:45:00",t3_k548ef,gegxk86,UNKNOWN
"Your approach is pretty reductive of mental health issues that students face.   I have a decent GPA, and I've been exercising and eating enough. I'm literally in better shape than I've been before the pandemic.   Guess what? I'm depressed as hell, even while taking the maximum dosage of designer antidepressants that cost $127 dollars a MONTH with RAMQ insurance. Depression does NOT listen to logic or reason, and it doesn't need to have an underlying cause.   SSRIs are not a magic bullet. SNRIs are not a magic bullet. Even CBT is not a magic bullet, though most students don't have the dough to drop the big bucks on therapists every week or every second week anyhow. Sometimes the biggest victory of the day is showering or eating or getting out of bed, and that's fine. That's the nature of the beast.   Your attitude of ""breaking the cycle"" yadda yadda is just annoying and places blame on the person dealing with depression, when people with depression already beat themselves up for not ""breaking the cycle"" or finding the ""underlying cause"" to their depression.   Sometimes there isn't one.   I'm guessing you don't have a mental health background, so I'd err on the side of caution and aim for a compassionate tone when talking to people who are dealing with a mental health crisis instead of trying to give people advice on how to handle it.   Saying that you ""Dealt with depression"" doesn't mean squat. Depression comes in so many different forms with so many different levels of severity. What you may think was your worst depressive episode might be a good day for OP. Some depressive episodes can only be handled with medication rather than therapy or logic, and even people in the field of mental health recognize this fact.   There are people who study mental health for years and can't easily address a patient's depression even with full knowledge of their medical history and background, so maybe you shouldn't try with a Reddit comment and aim for compassion.",German Studies & PoliSci Nut,Razwog,"12/03/2020, 08:31:46",t3_k548ef,gegwsdq,UNKNOWN

Eh samosa regulation is literally the extreme regulation Marx wanted...

"It's a little known fact that Karl Marx was himself a gulag. People think that he was a single white male author (typical), but in fact Marx was a concrete labour camp constructed by the Czar. His literary output is particularly impressive in light of the difficulties Marx experienced with not having limbs, a consciousness of his own, or writing implements.  While the USSR made good use of Marx throughout its various eras, some say Marx is now serving as Siberia's largest McDonald's following the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Reusable masks/surgeon's masks are not N95s, they will not prevent the spread of coronavirus. The impact is negligible.

"Well, the way I cook for myself during crunch times is in massive batches.   You can easily make a bomb spaghetti sauce in a massive batch (you can literally end up freezing a good chunk of your sauce if you have the freezer space). You can actually [freeze the sauce into ice-cube trays]( to make it super easy to defrost at a whim.   Then all you need to do is defrost the sauce and make some pasta and whammo, you've got a solid meal.   If you don't have loads of freezer space, you can just cook up a massive batch of spaghetti bolognese and eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Btw, if you're vegetarian you can absolutely still survive on spaghetti sauce, as long as you add lotsa cheese and stuff.    The other thing that can be done in massive batches is [fried rice.](  Then there's eggs. Eggs are so versatile. It takes minutes to cook up some scrambled eggs, and you can buy frozen hash browns in bulk from the store (which you can then put in a toaster oven), then have bread with it...and bam, that's a full dope breakfast in 15 minutes that won't mess up your kitchen much. **You can eat breakfast for dinner as well :D**  If you're feeling really, really pressed for time and find yourself ordering on ubereats, just buy frozen pizzas that are high quality with the expectation that you'll have a meltdown at some point.

"Who *doesn't* like spaghetti?   Just because you commented imma drop another spaghetti recipe. It's super fast and delicious. If you know this recipe already, you can ignore me, but this might be great for other students who are in a time crunch.    **Spaghetti alio e olio**  The ingredients required:   *  parmesan (yes I know, but its still cheaper than ordering in)  * pasta,   * garlic,  * fresh or dried parsley,   * chili flakes,   * butter,   * olive oil  * lemon/lemon juice.  **Step 1:** Start boiling water (throw in a lot of salt, tho that's obvious)  **Step 2:** As the water is slowwwwly coming to a boil, mince 2/3rds of a head of garlic (traditionalists say you're supposed to slice the garlic thin, but fuck em, my way is better) >:C  **Step 3:** Put a pan on medium heat. Put olive oil and butter into the pan (I eyeball the amounts, but if you like a recipe, [here you go]( then yeet all the garlic in. Traditionalists say ""only olive oil belongs in that pan"" but fuck em, my way is better >:C.  Butter turns the olive oil and garlic mixture saucy through the process of emulsification, and that's what you want.   **Step 4:** As the garlic starts to become golden, yeet in red chili flakes (don't throw in too many, oil makes chili flakes spicier and more aromatic) along with some pepper. Remember that you want to take the oil+butter+spices+garlic mixture off the heat a smidge before the garlic gets too toasty, because it'll continue cooking in the residual heat of the pan.   **Step 5:** By now your pasta is probably done. Strain that bitch, but leave enough pasta water to add to the pan (you can add around tablespoon of pasta water). Now you add the pasta to the pan with the sauce you've made, then throw in half a cup of parmesan.   **Step 6:** Now your spaghetti alio e olio is probably looking pretty dank but a bit monochromatic. Throw dried pre-chopped parsley on top of the pasta if you want to convince yourself that you've added parsley/greenery to your meal (people will say dried parsley has almost no flavor, and they're right, but we eat with our fuckin' eyes). Fresh parsley is always better, but what the hell is this, Buckingham palace?   **Step 7:** Do you have lemon juice? Dope, throw some lemon juice in the pasta to make it pop even more. I'm not saying you need to add a lemonaide stand's worth, but a drizzle will make it taste so good. If you have an actual honest to god lemon, get a grater and zest 1/3rd to 1/2th of the lemon's rind into the saucey pasta mix to lift the pasta into ""you're a fucking god"" territory. Still, that's optional.   The way I wrote that out makes it sound complex, but it's really not. It's only 30 minutes of work if you've got all the ingredients. You can use it to impress dates, or yourself quite honestly. I've also done the napkin math and its not super duper pricey, since the main cost is the parmesan and garlic.    If you're a visual learner, this youtuber is [dank and has a great recipe.](",German Studies & PoliSci Nut,Razwog,"03/23/2021, 01:35:42",t3_maxvph,grvpsf7,UNKNOWN

At some point I’ll fail to stop myself from at least renting one for a week. But deep down I’m still hoping that the R3 release drives down the price of the R5/R6.   How’s that vari-aperture on the lens? Does it get in the way? I have a Sigma 150-600 and the variable aperture is really annoying sometimes.,McGill Flying Club,light_blue_yonder,"09/08/2021, 03:10:50",t3_pjzxua,hc0kj8n,UNKNOWN
"Oh, I highly recommend you try out the R5/R6. The R5 has made me a true convert to mirrorless systems. I had my doubts before about the EVF. And based on what I've heard about the original R, not to mention many other brands' cameras (older generations), I think they were warranted. But the R5 and R6 make the EVF so smooth and so natural that it feels just like an optical viewfinder, but better. Exposure preview, the enhanced AF abilities, even MF assist --- all that stuff is super neat to have. A creature comfort is that I can just hit the playback button and review my shots in the viewfinder! Way better than whipping out the screen. Besides the mirrorless aspect, of course, the R5 and R6 are excellent image producers --- and IBIS is also great to have, especially when you double it up with an already-stabilized lens. Great for handheld shots (like all of these).  I somewhat doubt the R3 will significantly bring down the price of the R5 or R6. Time will, of course, as it always does, but the R3 just doesn't do the same stuff as the R5. It's going to be significantly more niche, I think, and the pixel-peepers and crop demons will take the R5 still because it's got more megapixelage. The R3 is really great for pro sports photogs who really need 30 fps instead of the 20 you get with the R5. (That's why R3 preprod units have been used at the Olympics alongside the 1DX Mark III.) Yes, the whole thing is very technologically exciting, with the stacked CMOS sensor. But unless you're shooting that fast --- and you're probably not --- you probably still go for the R5 or R6. What I think will lower the R5's price at some point is the rumored R5s (which is supposed to be 90MP, or 100MP, or 70MP, or something --- who knows, it's a rumor) --- but that's a ways away.  I don't really mind the vari-aperture, although I'm pretty fast to adjust it (and speed/ISO) as I see fit, so I don't really have any issues generally. Of course, if you like the whole aperture ring concept, you can set the RF control ring to aperture.  That Sigma 150-600 is a monster of a lens! Would love to try it out. (By the way, EF lenses work just as well as before, if not even better, on the R5/R6: just add the non-optical adapter and the cameras already speak EF lenses' native language.) The 100-500 is great, and a bit smaller too, so it fits better in my bag, although your lens is a bit faster for the most part. I've always loved telephoto lenses.","novus alumnus, quasi vetus",BeckoningVoice,"09/08/2021, 03:57:37",t3_pjzxua,hc0ppj0,UNKNOWN
"Oh wow, thanks for the VERY detailed reply!  I'm mostly a plane spotter who only conforms his gear to other photography tasks as best as possible, rather than the other way around. The 100-600mm is just too heavy. The aperture is already quite slow for a lot of the low-light fast-paced photography. I worked the entire [London Airshow evening show]( with my 70-200 f/2.8L IS because of that. and realistically, only the EF 100-400mm L lens fits my telephoto needs, but you know, $5000 and all that... I'm caught in a dilemma whether to go full-frame first or get the 400mm L lens first.",McGill Flying Club,light_blue_yonder,"09/08/2021, 22:22:17",t3_pjzxua,hc433eu,UNKNOWN
"The RF 100-500 is the successor to the EF 100-400, so you'd get pretty similar results from both. They're also both the same physical size (about 80% the size of your Sigma lens). That being said, the RF 100-500 does get slower slightly quicker for the most part (it's a touch slower at 400 than its EF predecessor). If you really need a speedy lens, though, this isn't going to be the ticket.  Is it better than the Sigma you have? Overall, yes, but it's not gonna be from speed. For what you want to do, you need to either (1) crank the ISO or (2) buy a fast telephoto prime (will give you a great picture for only like $15k!).  If you're shooting APS-C, and you want to use Canon ... going mirrorless (if you want to shoot on APS-C crop mode) is only going to be an upgrade if you go for the R5 which will give you results similar to the 7D Mark II, as it's very slightly less resolution than that, but newer and better high ISO performance (not to mention generally better IQ and AF). The R6... I mean, the IQ will be similar, but crop mode photos will be too small imo.  I shoot almost all in FF rather than crop mode (can do cropping in post ofc). This is great, and for this the R5 is only matched by the 5DS in the Canon DSLR space (which has very slightly higher resolution but slightly inferior IQ). But if you shoot FF and want to really take advantage of the camera for the same aerial shoots you'd need an even LONGER telephoto lens, and that would necessarily be a fast prime. And frankly without $20-30k and a back made of steel you're not getting that.

Apparently, a woman came running out of her apartment, off of her porch and fell onto the sidewalk. A man came running out after her with a large knife, jumped on top of her, and started stabbing her. As he was doing it, apparently he continued saying, ""im sorry I have to do this.""  He stayed on top of her until the police arrived, and gave himself up to them.

You may just want a simple plan of action starting right now, so I have written one out for you below.   **STEP 1 Tonight -- immediate need**: get in touch with keep.meSAFE ""free, confidential, 24/7 professional counselling service available to all McGill students, regardless of location. Download the MySSP app and chat or call for same-day support and/or appointment-based support."" **Goal**: to take the first step, perhaps get a few moments of relief from loneliness and distress, and a bit of energy and resolve to endure.   **STEP 2 Tomorrow -- rest and make a plan**: if you want, reach out the the same crisis line or try a new one. Commit to going to the clinic tomorrow and visualize it.  **Goal**: to regroup and focus (to whatever extent possible)  **Step 3 Monday -- get help**: You will go visit McGill Psychiatric Services (514-398-6019), which has safety appointments Monday to Friday 11:00 - 13:00 offered on a first-come, first served basis. **Goal**: To get onto a path of long term care solutions.

"Hey, I'm sorry to hear you're having a rough time.

There's also McGill's Peer Support Centre, which does active listening sessions, and Nightline if you're struggling mentally and need some support. * If you're about to run out for medications, the pharmacist can renew them temporarily until you get an appointment with your doctor. This might not work if it already ran out a while ago, but you can ask. * You family doctor can write you a referral to a psychiatrist (which you usually don't need an appointment for), and then you can see a psychiatrist through McGill. You can also make an appointment at any other clinic if you want. You can also get free counselling whenever you want (like, right now if you choose) through the keep.meSAFE app. It's paid for in your student fees.  * If you're looking for friends, you can join almost any club at McGill any time you want.

I myself still haven’t managed to make friends but I’ve gotten stable footing on other parts of my life and that’s better than nothing. Pls pls pls try and find a psychiatrist to see ASAP even if it’s not your usual because things will seem so much more manageable once your meds are sorted out!   just focus on eating well, getting sleep and so long as you make and try to achieve just ONE small goal a day (even if it’s just making your bed) you’ll feel a lot better about your day!  Also, I found that trying hobbies I may find fun helped a lot and could even come with opportunities to make friends (try reading clubs, pottery, archery, etc even if it’s something not offered at mcgill)!  Most importantly, you matter please don’t give up - hope comes from within you just need to be easy on yourself and find reason to carry on to the next day even it’s it’s for reasons as small as seeing the sun shine.

"mcgill actually has group therapy and I think even some clubs that relate to all things eating disorders and I think it could be really valuable to try to connect with them because eating in times of stress and panic attacks is a really tough issue to tackle and having a shoulder to lean on or even a counsellor could help! If not, making an appointment with a wellness counsellor in your department should be much easier and quicker to access than a psychiatrist just in the short term!   Like other commenters noted, there’s quite a few walk in clinics besides McGill’s that can see you within the same day and either get a psychiatrist referral (which you can use to see a psychiatrist at mcgill within less than a month) or just refill ur meds.  Lastly, i think a solid option would be to talk to your stepfather and be brutally honest about how your feeling even if this means he may be upset for a bit. If you need time to relax and just breathe I STRONGLY URGE you apply for a leave of absence (I believe it’s all online and it’s a fairly straightforward process) and go home for a semester.  Being out on the streets or in a shelter is just going to aggravate your mental state and if you think housing is too difficult to arrange than you need to consider going home ASAP! even if you miss a lab or assignment, consider going home for a few weeks now and just schedule a zoom meeting with your advisor to ask how you can take some time off!

"I think a simpler explanation is that averages were really high last semester and most profs were okay with an average being high in the middle of a worldwide crisis for a semester. However, as it became obvious that this was going to last at least two more semesters, profs started to think about a way to keep students accountable now that exams couldn't be used for that purpose.  In the past, if you did no work all semester, you would face risk of failing the final. In a world without real finals, the only way to ""reward"" students for working is to have regular small assessments. This will on average represent more work for both students and profs but it has the upside of giving the students opportunities to earn grades.  An argument could be made on the idea that during a pandemic, grades shouldn't matter at all and it wouldn't be an issue if everyone had an A, but while I don't think that's a stupid argument, I don't really agree with it because the whole academic system works based on GPA and giving everyone high GPAs for 3 semesters (which at mcgill represents near a half degree on average) would make high GPAs achieved before the pandemic near-meaningless. I do understand that there are pros and cons though. Note that the workload didn't change much in departments that weren't super focused on final exams, so Arts students will have seen less change than science students.

"I get like 14,000 in bursary with no repayment plus like 5000 in loan with repayment starting some number of months after the end of my degree each year. You get more for doing more credits (we do ~50 per year so it gives a lot). Based on conversations ive had with out of province students who are not eligible, it is much better than similar programs from other provinces.  It is also very important to mention that there is a number of conditions (having a bachelors degree, being in continuing education, living alone for x years, parents deceased, etc), which are major determinants on the amount of money they give. If you fulfill one if these condition, your parents have no contribution. Otherwise, your parents are expected to contribute a portion based on their salary, and the government pays that much less.  Also, if you work during school above a certain amount of money per year, you are expected to contribute, but your contribution is generally small unless you earn an insane amount for a student.

"Depending on your situation it may or may not be. After checking my account, the debt limit is in reference to the actual loan and does not include the bursary portion, so they provide you with more than $30,000 total. There is nothing that is stopping you from receiving more money from other sources. In some cases, other money will decrease the amount of the bursary portion and in other cases, the bursary is not affected. For example, RESP is exempt from the calculations of the bursary. There is also IIRC like a $5,000 buffer on other bursaries or scholarships. Like in my case, I received a $6,000 grant during my first AFE year, and $5,000 of it was exempt from the AFE calculations. In any event, unless you plan to take another degree (there is a month limit and in a second degree, there would be no parental contribution because you have a bachelor's degree, so you would get more money), there is no reason not to apply for AFE.",Medicine,0wnzl1f3,"06/04/2021, 04:18:46",t3_nrgpku,h0j1p7w,Medicine
"> Anyone also feel like they’ve just gotten dumber over the year? Like worse at writing, worse study habits, worse work ethic, worse everything.  To answer your question... Yes. Absolutely. Indubitably. My brain has a case of the Big Dumb, and I can't work like I normally do.   I think that there is an undeniable reality here--with this online university shit, it's hard to get and stay motivated (and it wasn't like I was high functioning busy beaver before COVID!). Going to campus, competing with keeners, and freaking out as a group in Redpath/Schulich gave my shriveled, gay, cherry-pit-sized-heart a lil' more life.   Humans are social animals. Without social interaction, we end up slowly losing our goddamn mind. There's a reason NASA trains its astronauts on how to deal with people when they have psychotic episodes--confined spaces and only socializing with the same people every day has a significant impact, even if you've had loads of healthy coping mechanisms instilled in you through top of the line training regimens.   It doesn't mean we should start organizing fight clubs and breathing all over each other bEcAuSe mEnTaL HeAltH, but we should at least cut ourselves some slack.

I’ve been trying to be open about how hard reading can be but it’s hard to talk about that one cuz I’m used to either not being believe or straight up mocked for it. Its actually happened at McGill were a prof didn’t believe ADHD was real and then intentionally made my life difficult/tried to fail me (I did try to pursue this but her superior was just and aged version of my evil prof so nothing could be done). Now that it’s been years and every prof since has been nothing but nice about it, I’ve finally started to realize that I was just uniquely unfortunate.

"Government funding has been going down rather regularly ever since the 2012 student strike, and McGill has offloaded the costs onto students, particularly undergrads, by cutting their own participation in the funding of several services (while also cutting down their operations as well), and cutting down into ""non-profitable"" departments / increasing student per TA ratio, etc, leaving SSMU to scramble to gap the holes. Several campus press/groups worked to highlight this between 2014 and 2017, not sure if the reports are still available tho.   They recently won a ""victory"" by gaining the right to deregulate international student fees tho, not like it led to any qualitative change into the situation (nor that it is fair in any way either).   Meanwhile McGill admin makes it a pride to go suck up to the worst corporate and state actors of the world in Davos to rake in some precious donations and investment agreements, anyone who thinks grad donations has the slightest capacity to switch the shitty choices of admin are deluding themselves, the scales of donations are no where near each other regardless.

"Having graduated and being in the workforce, I am often quite nostalgic about my time in university. I did struggle a lot as a student, but it doesn't that bad now looking back.   I definitely miss the social life and took that one for granted. Whenever I would walk around campus, I'd always stumble across some friends. We'd chit chat a bit or hang out. It was just really easy to maintain friends since they were all around the same place. I'd also go out every week and would see several of my friends for some beers. Nowadays, with everyone working, and not all in the same city, it feels like a constant battle to keep people from drifting away.   I also miss the fuckery you could get away with in college. Going out a couple times a week, pub crawls, E-weeks, Carnivals... all are things you can only get away with doing when you're young and in college. Now, you have responsibilities and too little free time to spend it hungover. To be honest, I don't really want to go on benders anymore, but I did find it fun at the time and miss that carefree spirit.   I miss the hopefulness of starting a new semester and the feeling of victory after overcoming a particularly difficult semester.

This is despite their own website stating that ""ALL 3U, 3M, 4U, AND 4M"" courses should be included in the scholarship average. (there is a 96% grade 11+12 cumulative avg cutoff for major and automatic scholarship consideration)  If they aren't including it in the scholarship average, then I imagine it is the same for TGJ4M1, and some other grade 12 courses in their ADMISSIONS top 6 average calculation.  **If you know people with supposedly lower top 6s who've been accepted while you haven't, this may be why.**  Genuinely so unbelievably frustrating, non-transparent, arbitrary, and honestly just BS.",Management,toasterOnYourLeft,"04/15/2021, 16:27:02",t3_kzhwd3,gumco3t,Management

"It's totally normal to feel a little hopeless, especially in these times, and I think it's taking a hit on a lot of people. However, suicide idealization is a serious mental health issue and I would *strongly* suggest seeking the help of a qualified professional. If you have McGill insurance it covers a big chunk of it, and if not you can see the Wellness Hub for a short term consultation or [Montreal Therapy]( for sliding scale fees. If you ever do consider suicide, please reach out to someone or give the Canadian Suicide Hotline a call at 1-833 456-4566. Therapy can also really help change your outlook on life and give you more coping strategies for when you're feeling this way. I can't recommend it enough.   I don't know how much of a help a stranger over the internet is, but please know that many people who feel like this at some point make a very full recovery and go on to live long and wonderful lives full of hope and love. COVID will surely affect the future we have, but I think it's important that we hold onto the hope that we'll get out of it eventually. Sure, the world might not be the same as before, but that doesn't mean it won't be worth living in or that COVID will only have negative outcomes. While the weather is still decent maybe try seeing some friends (masks on, socially distant) outside.

">I'm starting to wonder whether governments should consider whether the horrendous mental health implications outweigh the 20/30 deaths a day from COVID, which frankly are mostly among elderly people who are likely going to die in the next few years anyway.  Oof. I really don't like that take. Eventually we're going to become old too, and I wouldn't want the younger generation to glibly say that the lives of the elderly aren't worth protecting. That kind of attitude could seriously bite us in the ass in the future. There are other ways to improve the mental health of students here at McGill without putting our elderly on a sacrificial altar. Frankly I think it's a heartless take at best.   My father is immunocompromised because he's taking chemo, and my mum has a history of pneumonia. If they got covid, they would probably die, even though they are both 65.   On top of that, we have no idea what the long term effects of COVID-19 are.

"Yeah especially from someone like myself it's an uncharacteristically extreme view, and I wouldn't blame people for downvoting me. Perhaps I was a bit blunt, but I just think the way some governments (or at least my government) are going about handling it is a bit clumsy.  IMO people need to be given more the chance to take more personal responsibility - let people who want to work do so under as many precautions as possible, and focus the money and resources to make it easier for people who want or need to shield to do so, like subsidising food deliveries and working with councils to implement support groups for vulnerable people. This way people who are vulnerable to the virus don't have any pressure to go out and expose themselves to danger.  Obviously though masks and social distancing should be mandated, fuck people who think it's a 'violation of their freedom' to wear a mask.

To give you an idea, the quebec government insisted they were trusting the police's judgement and years of experience exerting judgement in dealings with homeless people when they announced the curfew.

Anyways, to finish off, I've shared my notes on FB cause I feel that the hassle of dealing with OSD is not worth the inconvenience (and that's coming from someone arguing on the internet). 1) The people from OSD likely have Facebook or friends on Facebook that can relay the notes. 2) people not in OSD might have sick days, or other shit going on in their lives keeping them from being taking notes every class.  I guess I agree that osd notaking shouldn't exist because everyone should be sharing their notes instead of hiding/trading them like cigarettes and ramen. But I have yet to see a class with many people sharing their notes.  That being said, for people working for osd, seeing one of your sources of income get slashed every year kinda sucks, cause income stability is kind've a cool thing you know.

"I think it's important to stay level-headed when it comes to these things and remember that the PQ is a party that has become very marginalized in the last 5 years, and they no longer represent a significant proportion of quebecois when they make statements like this.   I think some of the comments you are referring to kind of over-interprets the lack of university funding from the government. All universities in Quebec are underfunded at the moment (UdeM being a mild exception due to the AI stuff but that's a long story) and while there is a major issue with financing education in Quebec which is linked to the low tuition Quebec students pay (paying low tuition is good but it's expensive to the government), I think the underfunding of McGill is more due to the general underfunding of universities in Quebec than animosity from Quebec.   McGill actually thrived in the 2000s and reached high peaks in rankings after decades of existence under francophone Quebec governments because the Quebec political class cared about education in general back then, and no longer cares now. At least not enough to face the rising costs associated with existing as a university.  Don't get me wrong, you will find intolerant people who really dislike the fact that the best university in Quebec operates in English, but I don't think they represent a majority or even that strong of a minority. If they did, the PQ would not be constantly attacking the CAQ for ""funding mcgill too much"", and mcgill would not have escaped bill 96 (or bill 21 for that matter). Not that either bill is a good bill. I just think it's important to understand that McGill has a lot of qc franco students, a lot of qc franco administrators, and is a big participant to life in Montreal and a big piece of the Quebec public education system.  I understand that the recent anglophobic (I don't think there's any other word that's appropriate at this point) stances from the PQ since they got their new leader sound really bad. I'm not claiming that they don't, they really do, because they completely exclude the possibility of francophones benefiting from English education and their general stance about the funding of English education is complete nonsense. I just really want to stress that this party is polling very poorly in Quebec and even worse in Montreal, that they are currently projected to get around 2 seats out of 125 next elections, and that the reason they are so loud is specifically because their message no longer matches what the population wants and they're getting desperate.  I don't think there's any reason McGill can't thrive in Quebec like it did 10 to 20 years ago. We just need a government that actually cares about education and updates university funding to standards that are reasonable in the 2020s.",snowflake changed my flair,Thermidorien,"06/10/2021, 22:22:15",t3_nwukcn,h1c2wbm,UNKNOWN

Of course, I'm going to stay home if I am symptomatic but like... I'd be really worried about its impact on academics? Like having to stay home for two weeks means missing up to 6 labs for me (lectures as well but those are recorded so it's fine). Profs are supposed to provide some sort of accommodations but really what that's going to mean in the end, usually, is not being able to do something to make up for it it's going to be like redistributing the weight onto an exam or some other labs or smth, which ig there's not much else that can be done, but still would definitely suck.  What if I get sick during midterm/finals? I have a prof who said they're requiring a doctor's note if you miss the midterm (which is in-person) but that's... not reasonable if I've just got mild symptoms? What would I do in that situation? And especially with finals like... that would be such a mess wtf, some people are going to have covid for sure and there's gonna be ton of other people with the sniffles cuz welcome to winter and these people are all \*supposed\* to be staying home and isolating.  tldr I'm glad to be back but some logistical aspects of this whole situation are kinda anxiety-inducing cuz the implications of getting covid seem quite stressful and cuz let's be realistic, this is not ""back to normal"" yet, but hopefully it's a step towards there :')",Pharmacology,Roar2737,"09/14/2021, 16:09:56",t3_pnizzo,hcu2sgr,Medicine

Why can't those of us with immune problems, those of us with medical conditions or loved ones who are vulnerable, hell even those of us who are really anxious have the choice to remain online? McGill has clearly demonstrated that they are capable of offering it online, even if it isn't fun.  I managed to get an online-only schedule, but am still being forced in to campus for assessments. I've tried to get through the bureaucracy and have essentially been told I have no options. It seems crazy to make this mandatory in a pandemic. It's really looking like I'll be forced to withdraw for the semester because of it.

I’m for keeping classes in person, but I think that doing simple things like keeping your mask on and trying to keep as much distancing as possible isn’t a bad thing.

Even with asthma, the chances of being a breakthrough case when being double vaxxed at this age is pretty darn low. Vaccines WORK.   My ENT is confident they will work for me in the event I get COVID, especially at this age. It's probably the same for most of y'all who have asthma and are concerned.

"I'd say avoid a building if their tenants are mostly students. They know that most of the students don't actually know the laws, and that you most probably won't go to the Regie if you have a problem.  That being said, take pictures/videos when you have a problem and just go to the regie.  I heard that a building in the ghetto asks $200 as a move-out fee. What the hell?  Most of the apartment buildings are quite old, and you're going to have problems. But at least I get notified well in advance if someone's going to enter my apartment, because if they don't , they know that someone that's been living in the building for 30 something years is going to yell at them.

"I knew that housing in the ghetto wasn't good, but these nightmarish stories by other users have really driven home this point.  I'm glad that I now live in NDG paying $650 a month for a large 1.5 (technically the size of a 2.5, \~350 square feet) and my building is managed by a large property management firm. Not gonna mention names here bcus I don't want others to misinterpret this as a complaint since this is a ""do not rent"" thread. While my apartment is old-ish and will be due for renovation soon, I've had no complaints with the management and the few times that I've asked them for repairs, they usually come on the same day and fix them without issues (and the repairman is pretty friendly too). They're also quite good at communicating with us by leaving notices on our doors  and in common areas well in advance of any important events (e.g., lease renewal, fire alarm testing, releve 31 tax form pick-up). I also have a fitness center, swimming pool (all closed due to COVID) and dep in the basement too (at no extra charge), and all utilities are included in my rent. Sound and thermal insulation is pretty good too and the only time I hear my neighbours is when they turn their subwoofers on and have a dance party (not that often).  They've also made nice renovations to the common areas since I moved in 1.5 years ago and installed a contactless key card system for the main entrance and made the building more accessible to wheelchair users.  This is in stark contrast to when I was living in the Ghetto along Sainte-Famille near Prince Arthur from 2016 to 2018. I was paying around $850 for a tiny 2.5 (technically the size of a 1.5, 200 square feet) and the sound insulation was meh as I could hear my neighbours' footsteps upstairs a lot of the time. The landlord was responsive to repair requests though.

The land lady is very cooky. The first floor smoke is tolerable for me cause you only use it to enter but do not live on her floor which is third if you live here! I’m sorry she said racist comments; I definitely hear some inappropriate things a lot, luckily hasn’t been directed at me (yet). If you do something wrong she gets overly mad, so I really try and stay on her good side. She actually helped me find a sublet so I appreciated her for that! She is something to consider when living here though, but IMO the worst is some unpleasant conversations about other tenants because she likes to rant.  I actually think the price is worth it overall, like looking at the comments people paid 1k+ for much worst management. The worst thing that’s happened to me is sometimes smoke smell travels, but I’ve had this in every apartment and residence too.

"i lived there and actually (considering this was several years ago) for the time it was pretty cheap. I actually had an pretty large amount of problems with them though, Gabrielle and her mother (?) as well as other people I knew who lived in the building all had problems as well. The worst of it was when they encouraged us to renovate our kitchen in our unit citing that it would take 2-3 weeks, and in total we were left for about 2 months without a kitchen or living room. Other friends of ours had also issues with their units being in various states of renovations that took a very long time.  I was told by some of the contractors that a large reason why it took long was because many people got frustrated working with the mother lol. I also just feel betrayed because all along signing the lease I dealt with the father (?) George who disappeared as soon as we moved in and we only dealt with the mother.  This isn't to mention other things like the way they deal with people and hounding tenants for various infractions.

Was a tenant for 2019-2020 and had no problems with them :) (no bugs thank god) My only minor complaint is that my apartment was really hot in the winter but it seems like other units found it fine or cold - so I guess it depends where you are in the building. Plus I’d rather be a little too hot than too cold. Landlord is intense but very efficient and location is really great with apartments that are in good condition (some are newer/more renovated than others).
