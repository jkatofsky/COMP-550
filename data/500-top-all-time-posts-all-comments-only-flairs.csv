"As a former invigilator: we hate it too. The field house is slightly better for us because it doesn't crinkle or echo, but they're both horrible. Smaller rooms are way better (and so is invigilating law exams).  Invigilators are also sadly forced to tell you your bag and coat have to be under your desk.

"While using someone else's picture is not the classiest thing you can possibly do, I'm not convinced this is infringing on any copyright, and OP didn't pretend to have taken the picture. I think if you were to google ""mcgill gym exams"" or something and take the first pic you see to post it on reddit you would get the same outcome (using someone else's picture). So If we applied Rule 10 that way, no one would ever be allowed to post any images except pictures they specifically took themselves, and that would take away from the content on the subreddit significantly.  Overall, I don't see any intent to harm in sharing a memory of the gym and I think this post serves that purpose without causing you harm.","snowflake changed my flair","Thermidorien","12/03/2020, 22:15:48","t3_k5z2xa","geja5d9"

For example in Phys 131 we had a lot of things boosting our grade like perusal and CAPA. However Ragan also butchered us on formative quizzes where the average was like mid 60’s. The final had an average of around 70. So I’d say for that class at least, the average will be in the normal B/B+ range.","You may assume 𝜋=5","Aqua314","01/12/2021, 22:56:50","t3_kw1i8e","gj1w48q"

"Don't get me wrong, I understand the balancing act our government and health authorities need to perform (slowing the spread, prevent the healthcare system from being under-resourced and overburdened, and all while keeping the economy going). But, given the trends, I'm severely disappointed with Canada's and McGill's response to COVID-19. There is, at the very least, a strong precedent that current containment efforts in Canada will also fail, leading to community spread. That's a scary thought, even if the average incubation period is a conservative number of days. In fact, it would definitely not be a dubious assumption to take that possibility as a given at this point. Since any uncontrolled growth of a population (including viruses) is exponential in nature, promoting slightly stricter safety measures only when a sudden surge of cases cluster around us may not be sufficient to slow down the spread significantly. For all we know, nothing less than the harsh containment efforts in the East can possibly slow down the spread enough to allow more recoveries than infections, and I highly doubt most of those measures are possible to implement here in North America.   Given the trends, Canada and McGill University SHOULD promote remote work, much like Princeton University is doing now.    Our community needs to go above and beyond what's being recommended right now if we want prevention or even alleviate the almost certain damage control that needs to be done in the coming weeks. Promote social distancing. Discourage penalizing students for not attending lectures in person. Consider alternate marking schemes that emphasize remote work.   All McGill University is doing right now is encouraging ill-informed complacency and are not actually preparing students for a possible outbreak. ""Don't worry, wash your hands, consider staying home if you have the sniffles"", is the overall message given in the McGill coronavirus email updates for the past weeks. In my honest opinion, that just shows that our University prefers minimizing the disruption of people's lives rather than maximizing the safety of the members of its community. We should all do better.","Software Engineering","DarienMC","03/09/2020, 22:41:35","t3_fg29hd","fk25oxm"

"> now at least more innocent African Americans can be jailed and our working class can be sent to more foreign conflicts because a colored woman is in government  Yes, Kamala Harris is personally responsible for the privatization of the prison system in and the overincarceration of POC individuals in America. I bet she's going to egg on Biden to get the US to participate in more foreign conflicts.   Seriously speaking, there's really no correlation between Kamala Harris and these very real issues that need to be addressed.   Saying what you said doesn't actually help address any of the issues America faces right now. Being woke needs to be grounded in the actual reality of how governments function (especially a divided, gridlocked and partisan government with a republican party that runs on a strict diet of proto-fascism and white nationalism). Oh, and the downright racist Republican propaganda that FOX propagates on the daily, especially with regards to POC individuals.   Legitimately, this kind of overly cynical approach helps put Republicans and Democrats in the same league of shittiness, when that is absolutely not the case.   Democrats have been facing total gridlock in America for the last 8+ years, due to the fact that the Republican party refuses to work in a bipartisan manner. Republicans need to be brought kicking and screaming into the 21st century. **When Democrats do nothing, it's because their hands are politically tied.**  While I love people like Bernie Sanders, people who appear too left wing get absolutely crucified in elections within America. Trump won Florida by saying ""socialism"" a bunch of times. It's a real issue.   What politicians do strategically often do not line up with what they actually *want* to do. Keeping that in mind, I don't understand why people dislike Harris so much.   This is the democratic party that managed to win the presidency, win back the senate in Georgia (ofc with tons of help from Stacey Abrams) and retain control of the house. For now, it is *not* the time to dunk on democratic strategy, because it **worked**.  These issues will not be fixed overnight. The Georgia senate race proved that the POC community can have a real impact on American democracy. Kamala Harris being VP *is* a positive thing imo. I think she's more savvy and strategic than you think.   Give her a chance in her role as VP before virtue signaling willy-nilly.  **Edit:** I'm open to changing my mind.

Oh, and the downright racist Republican propaganda that FOX propagates on the daily, especially with regards to POC individuals""  This is all based in fact. Here's *one* example of *many*:   * When George Floyd died, the talking heads on FOX mainly talked about his criminal record and how violent BLM are in spite of the fact that his neck was knelt on for 9 minutes straight  VS  * Ashley Babbit is called a ""veteran"" and her death is painted as ""tragic"" even though she had an extensive criminal record, and she was a terrorist invading the capitol as an insurrectionist.

That makes everything I said based in reality rather than hyperbole.  As some conservatives love to say, ""facts don't care about your feelings."" Republicans were actively complicit in a coup attempt, and most Republicans in the House and Senate refused to denounce their president after he incited an insurrection.

Prosecuting parents is just too extreme.","German Studies & PoliSci Nut","Razwog","01/21/2021, 01:57:14","t3_l1dhug","gk0k4kf"

"> The point was that you called the entire Republican Party racist and ""proto-facist"". That is hyperbolic.  How? How is it hyperbolic? The onus is on you to prove that, not me. Particularly after the events of January 6th. When...  * members of the House give guided tours days before the insurrection  * the Commander in Chief refuses to call the National Guard during a coup attempt, forcing Mike Pence to call in the National Guard instead  * a member of the House (Lauren Boebert) **livetweets** the location of Speaker of the House Pelosi, thereby endangering her life  * when Republicans such as Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz undermine the legitimacy of American democracy by claiming it was an unfair election and that there were irregularities (irregularities that were laughed out of court no less than 60 times, and was not even considered by a Supreme Court that is controlled by a Republican majority)   *  Right after the events of the Capitol Riot, I watched the entire impeachment process on C-Span. One by one Republican after Republican talked about ""how violent"" BLM protesters are, then unequivocally refused to denounce a president who was trying to overthrow a **democratically elected government**. Yes, like the Nazis successfully did way back when. This is a rare case where it is not hyperbolic.   * 197 members of the House refused to denounce clear incitement of his supporters to overthrow a democratically elected government.   I can keep going. When the vast majority of Republicans can't even denounce a straight up coup attempt, *all my points stand*.   So what if there are extremely rare cases where Republicans do care about rule of law and democratic norms that are enshrined in the Constitution? The vast majority of the time, they work to undermine it. The facts overwhelmingly support this argument.   The onus is on the Republican party to shift away from falsehoods and back into enshrining democratic ideals rather than supporting racist demagogues.","German Studies & PoliSci Nut","Razwog","01/20/2021, 22:14:09","t3_l1dhug","gjztiuq"

"a couple others from my experience:  1. take however long you need to finish. it took me (and my mom!) eight years and three schools to finish our respective Bachelors’. I had to leave McGill after two years in 2013 and come back home, went to community college for a hot minute, then finished at a UC with my last year being an absolute trainwreck because of my father’s suicide the previous spring. no matter what, you’re getting the same piece of paper from anywhere and like a new car, the value of the name on that paper starts to matter a hell of a lot less as soon as you get it. (ironically, because of tuition hikes here, it cost about the same for California residents to attend UC Santa Cruz in 2014 as I paid at McGill for int’l Arts tuition 2010-2012)  2. HIGH SCHOOL DOES. NOT. DEFINE. YOUR. ACADEMIC. FUTURE. not at all. at Santa Cruz, my best friend in Linguistics had dropped out of high school at 16 with bad grades and got a GED, then transferred to UCSC from community college. he flourished and got a full ride for up to six years to do a PhD at U Chicago (which has a top 5 Ling program in the States), and I’m pretty sure that’s the best anyone in our department’s class that year did. most of my friends were CC transfers. most of us ended up in good grad programs.  just breathe, have a little optimistic nihilist moment about how all this matters less than you think it does in the moment. and to quote Fiona Apple, onward but not toward or away.","Linguistics","BettyCrunker","12/06/2020, 20:37:54","t3_k7ywzy","gevdf54"

"To answer your question, I think it is easy to feel like the democratic candidate is superior when the Trump administration set the bar lower than any president has in history.   From their perspective, Democrats have been suffering through   * A president who lost the popular vote by millions and still won because of the electoral college  * A president with a huge problematic history of dealings with Russia and the Ukraine, who encouraged voter manipulation in the 2016 election and had a campaign manager (Paul Manafort) who is now *in jail* and worked for Trump for free while being millions of dollars in debt to Russian oligarchs  * A president who paid $750 dollars taxes in 2016 (this had to be uncovered by the press) and refuses to release his complete tax returns  * A president who has a slew of sexual misconduct allegations that make Bill Clinton's affair with Monika Lewinsky look like a baptism    * A president who refuses to give DNA while one of his victims (E. Jean Carrot) still has a coat with her assaulter's DNA on it  * A president who said there were ""Good people on both sides"" after a rally in Charlottesville that had white supremacists (not even wearing hoods!) openly rioting with tiki torches  * A president who refused to condemn white supremacy *during a presidential debate*, and then said ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by"" referring to a far-right domestic terrorist organization  * A president who separated 500+ children from their parents. This violated human rights acts that America is supposed to champion, along with spitting on international law, as a lot of these migrants had the legal right to request asylum  * A president who has threatened to withdraw from NATO, which weakened international trust in America and alienated crucial allies in the process    * A president with a lawyer (Michel Cohen) who got raided and jailed on 8 counts of financial crimes while working for Donald Trump  * A president with yet another lawyer (Rudy Giuliani) literally saying that there was a 50/50 chance a person he met in the Ukraine was a spy    * A president who has cozied up to dictators and openly admired them  * A president who has openly stated that he believes Putin over intelligence from the US intelligence community *while at a press conference*  * A president who has refused to wear face masks, and had downplayed Covid-19 when it emerged. America has the highest per-capita death toll in the world.       * A president who dismantled the vast majority of the pandemic task force administration that was created in order to handle epidemics like ebola  washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/20/was-white-house-office-global-pandemics-eliminated/    * A president who has openly proclaimed that he will not peacefully transfer power. This is unprecedented in American history.   * A president who refuses to concede an election, and has sued several states to attempt to prevent further ballot counting  **Disregard climate change for a moment and look at that list. There's a reason that democrats see the people they support as superior. It's because there isn't a bar that could get lower.**  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  **Finally, the idea that playing nice with Republicans is strategically a good thing is also flawed.** Obama attempted to work with Republicans, and he lost a Supreme Court seat due to a precedent Mitch McConnell set, then refused to honor for his own party, unfairly netting the Republicans two seats. This is something that Mitch McConnell himself regards as one of his greatest moments:     **A lot of Republicans see kindness as a weakness, and will exploit it at every opportunity to win. Trying to work across the aisle is seen as weakness and is exploited as much as possible.**  EDIT: If you want to understand a bit more of what I mean, please give this video a watch. It's long but it has well developed arguments.   That's the reason that strong man politics work on that group of people--the very thing that Conservatives complain about is the same thing that they listen to. Conservatives complain about democrats telling them their points are stupid because incredulity and a refusal to normalize this behavior is kryptonite for them.   When conservatives say ""Democrats are being mean to us"" they are essentially using that as the argument rather than addressing the fact that their ideas are baloney.  **If someone has willingness to start a discussion in a respectful fashion without arguing in bad faith, all of your points stand.

"You're getting downvoted because there isn't ""a lesson to be learned"" here.

This is something we know in political science.   Go to pretty much any Polisci prof at McGill (people who study politics & political institutions for a living) and they'll agree with me, because there is an objective truth here--that Trump cannot and should not be placed on the same pedestal as Biden.

">My whole point is, that there is no objective right or wrong, it is how we look at it.  This is a problematic assertion. You can't say the moon is made of cheese or that the Earth is flat. There are objective facts, and there are some facts that should not be seen as things that should be given equal weight or treated with respect. The same goes for moral arguments. There are some things that are just immoral, like an administration locking 500+ children of asylum seekers in cages.   There should be no whataboutism when it comes to an administration that refuses to condemn white supremacy. If you think that is not an objective moral fact, that's problematic.   >Let’s say you consider them disgusting and then insult them and consider yourself superior, these leads to discrimination against one side. People start feelong marginalized and act more violent than they would have otherwise.  I'm not saying Trump supporters should be treated with unnecessary cruelty. I'm saying that in light of all the odious, objective facts we know, it is not beneficial to American democracy to pretend that there are two sides that have equal value, because one side is at this point supporting fascism.

"If the best argument in favor of someone's political views is that the other side is dismissive, obnoxious, or mean, then that person probably does not have the facts on their side.   If liberals based their political arguments on the notion that conservatives or Trump supporters have been mean to them, they would be laughed out of politics.   The notion that the extreme far-right views of conservatives and Trump supporters are the fault of mean liberals is a laughable excuse for believing things which are not based on facts and sound argumentation.     The other thing is that people who right do not hold themselves to the same standard. You have people like Ben Shapiro telling liberals that ""facts don't care about their feelings, sweaty,"" and right-wingers who literally are in support of fascism. People should not be encouraged to normalize fascism by treating fascists as belonging to different sides of the same coin. Full stop.   Why should liberals be held to a far higher standard while tiki-torch wielding Trump supporters go to Charlottesville chanting ""They will not replace us"" and then their white supremacy is LITERALLY ENDORSED by a sitting president?   Finally, I've got to point out that Trump has never won the popular vote. Just because a good chunk of the country is uneducated on fascism and hate people who are educated does not mean that they should be coddled for supporting a fascist.   Fascists do not change their mind unless they are shamed into doing so. The lesson to learn here is that Trump was the culmination of the Southern strategy.

Repeatedly refusing to condemn hate acts committed by his supporters, as well as openly supporting violence against his political opponents is extremely irresponsible (and that is an understatement). It's not just a ""twitter soundbite"", and if you really think this is just ""misinformed students getting upset over Twitter"", I think you are missing the point. The most, most, most basic expectation of the leader of a nation is that he shouldn't support violence from some members of that nations against others. If someone can't even do that then they have no business being anywhere in politics, let alone president.

"> Im not saying mcgill shouldn’t push for a policy plan to return with effective health measures - Im saying why don’t they offer a remote style option for less privileged students who got hit harder by the pandemic financially than the cake-eaters in the above video? If the university truly cared about empowering students, they’d give students a choice.  The issue that comes up here is that of assessments. A big reason for return to in-person is the ability to have in-person exams (even if you have to scatter them through a full month to keep distances). Having in-person exams would allow profs to structure courses in a way that would be a LOT more enjoyable for students even if those courses are mostly remote. Having an option to be fully remote means that you can't possibly have in-person exams and that defeats a lot of the point of returning to in-person at least from an academic perspective.  There is no trivial option to give students a choice without giving up on a lot of the reasons to return to in person teaching.","snowflake changed my flair","Thermidorien","04/10/2021, 19:27:49","t3_mny5mt","gu2n5wl"
"The restrictions aren’t laws, they are special measures that the government can only issue under the “etat d’urgence sanitaire” since March 2020. In other words, the restrictions we are seeing actually go against our law&rights, but we’ve put in place as a society a system for when a pandemic/war happens so that the government can deal with the situation more effectively by assuming more power.  That is why you can’t compare a cop arresting people for sanitary restrictions and a cop arresting someone for driving to fast or murdering people.  The “etat d’urgence sanitaire” is a last resort tool used by the government, and I’m not against it whatsoever considering the pandemic. However, we have to understand the government is walking on a path and building it at the same time.   Consequently, it’s understandable that they are less comfortable with this new extraordinary authority they have, and thus won’t press on it too much.","Anal Del Rey","ultraviolencelover","04/10/2021, 16:22:13","t3_mny5mt","gu2163m"

Regardless this is irrelevant to the conversation. We’re talking about authority intervening. That would result without a doubt in protest, just like what’s happening in Belgium.

"> That’s a really good point, and Im sure the university loves to hear that.  Students also love to hear that, not having in person exams sucks for everyone.  > If they found a way to administer MCATs and the law bar exams online this past year (the ones with webcam surveillance), there’s no reason why this alternative solution wouldn’t work.  Webcam proctored exams are crazy invasive, do not actually stop people from cheating, necessitate a lot of resources to run and are still online exams which come with a shitload of limitations compared to in-person.  While they are an alternative, they are not at all a *good* alternative to in-person exam. MCATs and law bar exams used these kinds of methods because no better options were available. There is a reason they will go back to in-person exams when possible. Online exams suck for everyone, both faculty and students, and I think your statement that ""the majority of faculties rallied in a way to assess their students equally across a remote platform"" is misleading because I don't know a single faculty person who ""rallies"" behind online exams as an even remotely valid alternative to in-person exams. It feels like you're trying to make it sound like people are happy with online exams. People aren't.  if in-person exams are possible, people want in-person exams. I understand you personally find being present in person inconvenient but you cannot seriously make the claim that not having in-person exams isn't a big deal. It might not be possible to have that in the Fall for public health reasons but there are very good reasons to try.","snowflake changed my flair","Thermidorien","04/10/2021, 19:47:56","t3_mny5mt","gu2pi77"

"I thought I knew what I was getting into when I decided to come to McGill. I was wrong. I liken it to looking both ways before you cross the street, and then getting hit by an airplane.  My mental health was incredibly rough in first year. I had to seek help from Student Health, and I ended up seeing a psychiatrist a number of times.  I'm in second year now. My mental health is wayyyyy better, I don't see a psychiatrist anymore, and I feel like I've finally got my feet back under me and I'm ready to climb the mountain. Choosing McGill was hard, but I still think it was the right choice. I would not trade the friends and memories I've made and the things I've learned for anything, and I've only been here for a year.  I wish I had known a couple things before I came. First is that the campus vibe, at least in my experience, is WAY different than I expected (I was picturing a Guelph or Western or Queen's type beat). My experience is that you have to seek out your social life a little bit more, and that most of the social events involve ""going out"" in some form. The drinking age is a plus if you know how to drink responsibly, but the weed age just got raised (goddamn CAQ).  Second, you might hear people say that McGill is a hard school, which has not been my experience here. I'd say that the most challenging aspect of it is the self discipline, which I sucked at. If you can stay on top of your work, and figure out what isn't working when something isn't going right, the marks should come (at least at the beginning). I had negative time management skills, severe mental health problems, and a kidney stone two days before an exam last year, and I still pulled out a 3.2 in my first year. That being said, I know I can do WAY better than that and I'm trying hard to improve my habits this year.  My time at McGill has been a rollercoaster, but I think I'm getting the hang of it now. If you do decide to come here, just come in expecting the unexpected and realize that no matter how hard you mentally prepare, things are not going to go as planned. C'est la vie! Montreal is an amazing city, McGill is a great school, and McGillians are some of the best people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.

"Although I understand the frustration and disappointment from many students, I think they made the right call. I'm immunocompromised and was thinking of taking a gap semester, which was really hard for me to come to terms with. Being able to take classes online means that I can continue my degree, graduate on time, and save some money by staying with family instead of leasing in Montreal.  So, for many, this is a sad time. However, there are likely equally as many students who are relieved by this decision - immunocompromised students, international students, and students who are strapped for cash. Montreal and all the fun it has to offer will be there, but for now, we need to prioritize the health and safety of our community.","Thai Express Hoe","Kitchen_Coconut","05/13/2020, 21:29:55","t3_gj68k7","fqj5oy5"

By switching to online-first, these students will not feel left out and are less likely to consider deferring their term.  If McGill really wants to prove that they are doing this for corona, they should acknowledge that online learning provides a lesser experience that could easily be found on platforms like Coursera and should thus charge a tuition that reflects that.","Software Engineering","Rainmaker0909","05/14/2020, 06:05:12","t3_gj68k7","fqku3au"

"Here’s their 2019 audit:   And here’s their budget book:   McGill currently spend 35M$/year on library services and another 28M$/year on institutions services. There are plenty of places where operational costs can be reduced while still enabling maintenance for continuation. You are right about tuition revenue representing a large portion. In fact, it’s 350M out of 1.4Bn.  I appreciate you understanding that this is a free market and that I can go to coursera. Unfortunately, my ancestor’s 50% marginal tax rate has already invested in McGill and the reason for doing so is the product offered by McGill provides superior education to tolls like coursera. However when you remove physical office hours, have profs who can’t figure out how to do online saying they’re too shy to speak in a virtual lecture, remove access to labs, libraries and services then the educational product loses much of its value.  I’m not saying that moving to virtual is a bad move. I absolutely agree that it must be done to preserve healthcare, but I am stating that McGill may have ulterior motives based on their current financial data and if they’re really doing so for the sake of society they would take measures on tuition to reflect so.","Software Engineering","Rainmaker0909","05/15/2020, 02:13:51","t3_gj68k7","fqo6y30"
"I really like reading these responses analyzing the issue of tuition reduction. On the other end, as a course instructor but also in student services while a PhD candidate, I've received multiple cuts in contracts and I'm not sure how many more cuts will be done (at least in my faculty as well as the departments that I work in) that pretty much reduces availability of university jobs where they are also students. It's complex I find... And like someone else suggested, being transparent would be the best approach since simply reducing tuition can have large ramifications to student jobs.","Psychology '14","EthanJJ","05/13/2020, 22:21:24","t3_gj68k7","fqjdol7"

"The point is that MCGILL DOESN'T TAKE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY. McGill has a history of covering up, keeping confidential, and brushing under the rug assault allegations. Even when McGill believes the allegations, professors are allowed to keep their jobs and sanctions given are completely unacceptable.   > According to Saideman, during his time at McGill, Professor B did, in fact, face some consequences following allegations of sexual harassment against him. In this case, a female graduate student had led the complaint against the professor, and the complaint was taken seriously. However, the sanctions taken against Professor B were questionable, in Saideman’s view.  >[...]  > As a sanction, Saideman wrote on his blog post, “he [Professor B] got moved out of his office in a remote location and put next to my office. I apparently was supposed to babysit/ monitor him (which was strange since I only learned of his behavior informally, not through the administration).” Moreover, Professor B was conditionally restricted from taking on graduate students following the investigation, but Saideman notes that “his ban of supervising grad students apparently has lapsed as well,” and it appears as though Professor B has taken on new female graduate students since the investigation.    The Daily and the Trib are too afraid of naming Ahmed Ibrahim because he's so agressive with his lawsuit threats.

"Okay so lots goes into making a house, and houses (especially for my family) are tied to a lot of debt. The house (the one we - as in my Grandma’s sibling, not my grandma herself - still own) has been mortgaged several times, we don’t own it outright. Loans were taken to afford the materials, etc. That said, the combined income of 11 people and their spouses, all working several jobs, went into this house. We didn’t just magically have the money, and yes we were poor and are still barely above the poverty line despite owning a large house. You also need to take into consideration how many people lived/live in these houses. There’s 4 different families and 4 generations living in the current house. Not that it’s a competition, but I’m not sure what part of owning a house means that my family is automatically better off than yours.

"This is the downside of the department system where departments have to deliver freshman courses to everyone. Even though the students are not math majors, the profs are math profs/lecturers who usually teach math courses and develop habits that are not compatible with faculty-wide freshman courses.  There are current issues with courses like MATH 323 and MATH 240 because they are taught by math profs to CS students and it ends up being absurdly hard some semesters when the instructors go all in.  If McGill cared about the problem they should hire Faculty lecturers (who actually answer to the faculty) for freshman courses who would basically be more like Pavelka and only focus on large undergraduate courses. The current system isn't fair anyway, with the CHEM and MATH departments having to provide extremely large courses for students of other departments. Those departments shouldn't have to foot the administrative bill of the freshman program, and a part of this kind of stuff we see is math professors pushing back against having to teach a bunch of freshmen with limited interest for math (with I think is somewhat understandable for both sides although this exam is clearly too extreme). The system worked when there were fewer students but clearly not anymore.","snowflake changed my flair","Thermidorien","04/23/2020, 18:40:44","t3_g6rxcf","foc57ai"
"The exam was definitely excessive in length and was inappropriate for the current situation. Math is likely one of the hardest subjects when it comes to proof-based problems rather than computational problems. Many first-year students struggle with MATH 133 because of this reason. I've heard that MATH 223 also had a long and difficult exam.  I think many of the questions itself were clever and fair, but just really time-consuming. I appreciate the questions -- I can see that the professors took a lot of effort creating them.

"I keep hearing that the class material did not prepare us for this final at all, or that the teaching was bad leading up to this final, but I have to respectfully disagree. The reason these questions are hard is because they are in an unfamiliar, proof-based style which take more time, deeper understanding, and a higher level of critical thinking. The professors realistically had no choice but to create these problems to prevent anyone from cheating with a calculator. The hardest textbook questions near the end of each chapter are actually proof-based and are similar in difficulty to the exam questions. In my opinion, the problem with this final is its length -- not the type of questions.

"> Suffice it to say they far exceeded the level of difficulty of the questions in the Stewart book.  That's really unfortunate – when I took the course in Winter 2015, I remember hearing the ""100 types of problems"" mantra from a friend in another section. The idea is that MATH 141 will teach 100 different types of problems throughout the course. If you can master recognizing and solving each type, typically by doing all the problems in Stewart, you'd be almost guaranteed to ace the course. I recall Sid Trudeau saying something similar on this subreddit, and even recommending other introductory calc textbooks to get even more practice with those 100 types (not sure if he mentioned the 100 types or not, though).","Not an authority figure '20","CatanOverlord","04/23/2020, 22:53:28","t3_g6rxcf","fodaybk"

Before you disagree that the problems are not an issue, please provide a better solution for the problems yourself. No one has done this so I am not convinced. I still disagree about the A class average. There is no good reason for this when the S/U option already exists.

"No worries. And I'm sorry to hear about your situation. That really does sound awful. I agree that in your case, and probably in many other students' cases, this exam sounds terribly unfair, especially those who actually worked hard. I think this exam is unfair for its length. Please don't make me repeat this. Let's get that out of the way now.  I agree that the problems given to us are very different in approach than the traditional problems (which are textbook problems). They were proof-based problems. We have never or rarely ever approached proof-based problems in class. There were only a few proof-based problems in the textbook. Proof-based problems are problems that require a lot of intuition over practice. This is why they are hard for so many students. Even I find it much harder than computation problems. I'm with you there.  What I've been saying is that there was no choice for this. There had to be proof-based problems. Because if the problems were to be like the textbook problems or the in-class problems, people would cheat their way with a calculator to get 100%, not actually doing the exam. This probably isn't what you mean or what you want, right? I'm willing to hear a different approach for the style of problems. What kind of problems do you think would have been suitable for this exam? Please be specific if possible.  I like responses like yours just now. Whenever I try to justify anything opposite to what the crowd thinks without being mean-spirited or callous, people will point fingers at me, saying I lack compassion, saying I'm condescending, and saying I'm privileged. These need to stop, please. I really only want to have a healthy discussion about this. And if things really go south, we can simply agree to disagree! There's nothing wrong with that. But my mind is subject to change if I hear a convincing argument. Almost no one wants to reason with me and only want to point fingers at me. This has been making me a bit upset.

However, I don’t think it’s a good idea to bring another movement in question and blame it for taking all the attention. Oppression olympics are a really bad game to play because they end up taking away from the common fight that we should all put on together. We all need to support each other and that will be hard if we instead antagonise other people’s movements. We can bring attention to the current problem without taking away to other problems.","former Trottier resident","xvd529fdnf","03/20/2021, 07:48:44","t3_m8sayo","grkjw0w"

"Right, I think there's a lot to be said for that. It seems to me that people only really listen when something big happens to spark it.  It really is the same with BLM if you think about it. People have been calling out these issues for ages and it took someone being mercilessly killed for the bulk of the population to listen.   It's the same with Islamophobia (particularly in Quebec). It took the Quebec City shooting for people to listen a bit (and even then, it wasn't nearly enough).   I think our best bet is to band together and remember that: if this time it's not me / my race, next time it might be.

"We've kinda had a similar discussion in [another thread]( though it was more bilingual-ish. For now, I'll keep this thread up in case anglophones didn't read the last thread :P  I read the article and agree with the main message. However, I do feel that the LaPresse article does lead readers down the route of sweeping statements that paint the whole student body with a broad brush. Samuel Veissière states that this is a ""generational problem"" and I don't like that idea. His statement ""La montée de cette culture est liée à une génération d’enfants-rois/the rise of this culture is linked with a generation of child kings,"" overgeneralizes the situation and annoys me.   That being said, I absolutely agree (and have previously noted) with the statement that the use of trigger warnings can easily become problematic for the mental health of the very people [trigger warnings are supposed to protect]( There's scant empirical evidence that supports the use of trigger warnings. If someone has evidence that supports the use of trigger warnings, I'd be happy to give it a read.   With that being said, I wouldn't throw out the baby with the bathwater. We can't disqualify everything left-wing/'woke' based on the frankly idiotic actions of one student, or the idiotic actions of McGill's administration. Not saying that you are doing that, but I've noticed that sometimes people use examples like this to excoriate students who happen to be left-wing, rather than filtering out the baloney.   I just hope that McGill's administration wisens up in cases where the student is simply in the wrong, such as in this case. Students are **not** always right, and that should be OK.","German Studies & PoliSci Nut","Razwog","02/23/2021, 01:34:57","t3_lq55qb","goervpp"

I understand it's possible it doesn't end up happening that way if things keep going well in terms of vaccination and public health stuff, but I am concerned for these students in the realistic scenario.

"I think barring students from registering would be pretty harsh. Right now, the government’s goal is to have everyone fully vaccinated by mid-late September, a bit after the add-drop deadline.   It seems likely we’ll have a lot of students with one vaccine on the first day of school, who are fully vaccinated by the end of September. But if we’re banning these students from even enrolling, then they can’t follow along online for any remote courses, or follow along a textbook. If they’re not fully vaccinated by Sept 15 and don’t register, they’ll have to miss the entire Fall semester.   I’ve also had to submit proof of vaccination for school in the US, but it was really easy to stop by any pharmacy to get a tetanus shot. I want the vaccine right now but can’t get fully vaccinated for several months, and don’t see why I should be forced to miss an entire semester because of that.","Mech Eng","BiggerD","04/21/2021, 12:53:20","t3_muu9sv","gvbgpcn"

McGill has very few rooms that can fit 150+ students. Even without social distancing, scheduling big classes is a nightmare, so any form of social distancing added to these constraints makes it difficult to have these classes in person, even in good scenarios. That is why even in ''back to normal'' they mention lectures under 150 being in person in their slides, and not big lectures.","snowflake changed my flair","Thermidorien","04/20/2021, 18:47:11","t3_muu9sv","gv8fhra"

"> If you go on r/professors there are several posts with profs talking about how they initiated investigations with Chegg and they have some good info there. They discuss the information Chegg was willing to provide them with, however IP address is not mentioned there nor in Chegg's terms of service. I would bet that people who are being told they were caught via their IP address were also setting off some other red blinking lights.  IP addresses are included in the information provided by chegg  > do they simply need to satisfy themselves in saying ""Someone at your address accessed this question on Chegg while you were writing your exam""   I agree that proving the cheating itself is difficult. My understanding, from the posts we have been seeing on the subreddit, is that faculties now encourage profs to clearly write ""you are not allowed to use websites like chegg"" and then they can use the chegg IP/chegg account/mycourses IP info to prove the student used chegg and limit themselves to trying to prove that,  rather than prove that the exam content is plagiarized.","snowflake changed my flair","Thermidorien","04/25/2021, 21:40:48","t3_mydq56","gvv1sa8"

"The way Chegg skirts around it is they make posters confirm it’s their own documents and not copyrighted material. Clearly it doesn’t work, since their business model relies on students violating the rules.   On the bright side, Chegg is extremely friendly with profs. They take down posts and share poster information pretty fast. If I was a prof, I’d rather deal with Chegg than the other sites that fight hard to keep the documents up, and keep popping up under different names/domains.","Mech Eng","BiggerD","04/26/2021, 00:54:27","t3_mydq56","gvvnme6"

She said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but she kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my food ordering, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen samosas in her hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Ma'am, you need to pay for those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When the cashier took one of the samosas and started scanning it multiple times, she stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each samosa and put them in a bag and started to say the price, she kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.","Engineering","MobilizeEngage","11/17/2020, 19:02:03","t3_jvynkn","gcmzsj6"

"Fellow TA here. Could you perhaps speak with the prof about recommending the student to OSD if it's a possibility that they have a learning disability?     Alternatively, though this is more a gripe at upper education as a whole, it's very possible that the student simply doesn't do well with standard assessment measures. It's not that they don't know the content but rather  their understanding isn't captured well by typical assessment styles like exams and essays. It would be nice if profs/TAs could try to recognize students like this and offer them a different form of assessment like a one-on-one discussion of the course material (some students can explain their knowledge verbally, but have immense difficulty writing about it).

"> As a Muslim, the lack of truth behind what you are saying is nauseating. I made a post trying to raise awareness for what Muslims were experiencing in China and it was promptly removed by moderators when all I asked was those who support the oppressed gather in a show of support/protest. Instead of writing a novel of BS, you could’ve been more truthful by just saying when you agree with the topic or when it’s convenient for you. All of the above reasons are the opposite reasons for why my post asking people to show solidarity with those in concentration camps was removed. Your exact words say it’s okay to foster a political debate yet when China is mistreating Muslims you remove the post, but when it’s Israel the oppression of Muslims matters. Got it. This thread is the McGill daily, just run by other McGill students.  We've had many discussions involving Uyghurs and persecutions in China on this subreddit. Seriously, search ""China"". We do not approve or disapprove posts based on whether we agree with the topic, and honestly I don't think it would make sense for anyone to be biased towards Palestine and biased against Uyghurs, I have never ever met someone with that set of positions, and that's certainly not the case of the McGill Daily. Have you considered your post might have been removed for other reasons? A lot of posts about events fall under our solicitation rules. Had you reached out to the mods before posting?  I've been repeatedly accused of being biased in favor of israel, against israel, against the CCP, in favor of the CCP, name it. At the end of the day we moderate posts based on how they fit with the posting guidelines and while we are not perfect, we do our best, and I am very comfortable with the current state of the posting guidelines. Being accused of personal bias against every single user who is unsatisfied with our work is just a daily part of moderating anything.

"I can't help but feel an ego thing in this. SSMU feels they weren't consulted enough for the project, so they're against it. It's just hard for me to see a reaction this strong being rational, the project presented by mcgill is pretty balanced.  Has McGill admin done a stellar job of running the school in the last 2 years? No, definitely definitely not. They should definitely be criticized for the stuff they mess up.  Should McGill have consulted students more in the process? I don't know the details but yeah, probably.  Is attempting to attach this issue to covid management and investments in fossil fuels a strong argument against New Vic? No, it really, really isn't. If there is something profundly wrong with this project it should stand on its own.  Do research labs, a library, and classrooms sound like something McGill and its student do need right now? It really does fit a direct need that will directly improve the quality of life of students.  Why does SSMU have to take such a hard stance here? There's still room on the site to do other stuff. We need classrooms, labs and library space anyway. Royal Vic has been associated to McGill pretty closely for well over 100 years and McGill could have very well ended up owning this space a long time ago. It's not like McGill is building on  parc Jeanne-Mance.  Why can't SSMU point out the lack of communication and transparency on the side of McGill (which appear to be present and worth criticizing) while adopting a minimally measured position and recognizing ANY of the positive sides of the project? Do they not realize that going all out against everything that they don't fully agree with is not the best way to convince people that they could play an important, constructive role as an interlocutor to McGill in the design of a project of this scale. And by people here, I mean both McGill admin, governments, and the students they represent.   McGill should strive for more transparency and exchange with students. God knows they fucked up on a lot of stuff in recent years. But this specific project actually includes a lot of stuff that the student body actually wants: space for students, more research and learning opportunities (especially centered around sustainability) more focus on sustainability in general, etc. Presenting this as some universally terrible, major fuckup from a dictatorial McGill admin is just not intellectually honest, and it's not a position that correctly represents the student body..  And honestly, accusing McGill of doing a performative consultation is... ambitious, coming from SSMU. How would this protest be any less performative than the consultations?","snowflake changed my flair","Thermidorien","09/22/2021, 02:33:22","t3_psxih6","hdsrajg"
"Does SSMU realize that the university needs more space to grow and thrive or is their goal just to complain? Long-term sustainability requires more space. Do they really think it is in anyone's benefit to have a debate in the National Assembly with the CAQ in power about what should happen to the site?

"I've been following this project since I moved to Montreal and I definitely agree with OP. There has been consultation. And from what I remember, the gov't had to be convinced to give some of the property to McGill -- and there were legitimate fears about what would happen to the space. Like it or not, it's a ton of real estate that needs extensive rennovation, and the main building also has heritage status, and comes with the complications that that entails. The best, and most public minded thing the city can do is to give it to McGill, and now there's the funding to turn it into something usable.

"It sure seems to me like this group of students is upset that the University management is in charge of managing. They call the planning committees obscure, just because they were not involved. It's almost like the university actually chose experienced and qualified individuals to plan this project, not a bunch of unqualified active students with half baked rainbow sunshine ideas. The SSMU is still a group of students. Students do learning, management does managing, it's just that simple. If you want to be involved, get a management degree, get experience in the industry, then come back once your in a position to say things worthwhile. The whole email sounded like a bunch of spoiled brats upset that they didn't get a seat at the big boy table working on the biggest, shiniest project right now.  One thing that really bothers me in the email is how they put the fossil fuel investments and COVID management as a footnote. Things that are more of an issue, that they protested heavily about for a little while, are now relegated to footnote mentions despite little having changed. It shows me that whether they care somewhat about the cause, what is most important for them is to enjoy the feeling of rebellion and protest against 'The Man', moving from hot topic to hot topic like fast fashion. It disgusts me. If an issue matters to us, stick with it until something is done. That is how change can be affected.  As a whole, it seems at times as though the SSMU simply despises the university it exists under. If these students are so upset with McGill's very existence then why do they go here. Sure they make a big fuss, protesting anything and everything about it while here, but these people will all benefit from a McGill degree in the end. They are reaping the benefits while trashing what gives them those very benefits.","Bioengineering","McGillMaster","09/27/2021, 14:49:39","t3_psxih6","heh74ea"

"But this letter is supposed to be about McGill's lack of consultation with how it's developed its plans for the use of the site, and the older letter is about the government of Quebec's lack of consultation in giving the land to McGill. That's not the same consultation; that's not the same organization. François Legault and Big Suze aren't the same person.  And fundamentally the complaint, despite saying that McGill's development contributes to the public good, seems to contradict itself in implying that if McGill is using the land it cannot be dedicated to the public good, which seems strange to me, as the university is publicly funded and meant to provide a public good. The header of the letter calls for people to reject the privatization of and condominium development at the Royal Vic site. But then the connection to McGill seems to be then that McGill could one day, after building and presumably using this plot of land as campus space, sell it to a real estate developer to be converted into a luxury housing development. That seems a little tenuous.  Could the consultation by Quebec have been more comprehensive? Sure, probably. Could McGill's? Again, probably. But it's two different bodies having separate consultations along two stages through the greater part of a decade relating to McGill receiving and developing less than one fifth of the plot for the hospital long attached to McGill's campus.","novus alumnus, quasi vetus","BeckoningVoice","09/22/2021, 03:22:30","t3_psxih6","hdswx1f"

If you need something during your 14 day quarantine, there are phone numbers you can call to get items delivered to your door. There's no excuse.

"The problem is that there is no choice for professors or TAs - the admin is telling them to commute to work and teach in-person classes. In a deadly plague, not ideal.   But also, faculty have spent the past 7 months adapting their lessons for online learning. The admin is now saying “too bad, make it hybrid”. Classes are intense amounts of work, and this just makes it beyond what faculty can manage.   Even universities in small college towns are struggling to contain covid. McGill’s housing is out of control, Montreal’s cases are at 200-300 a day. If there was a covid case in a class, all human beings present would have to quarantine (not to mention, covid kills - people could die because McGill decided to open classes). Basically, profs are predicting that they wouldn’t get more than 2-3 weeks of teaching into the semester before having to shift back online all over again.   I hope this answers your questions!

There’s been no making sure that TA contracts permit them to choose between teaching online or in person (thereby risking either their health or their already minimal income). And all this lack of communication as Montreal is still firmly a red zone where we can’t legally visit and hug our families.  So unfortunately, it does appear on the surface as giving students a choice, but it’s been completely forced on everyone else on a Friday at 3pm with barely 48 working hours to organize a response.

It took months last time and that was when more things were closed and more people were scared enough to follow stay at home orders. I also expect a rise in cases after the holidays.

"I think you’re definitely right - from what I understood, this decision was completely based on trying to bring students on campus before they all lose it and drop their semesters instead of trying to do this for another 4 months.   The thing is just that they did it as a surprise on a Friday afternoon while we are in a red alert zone. Basically, they’re catering to the biggest demographic (undergrads who want to go to class) without listening to the people who have to make that happen and who also simultaneously are at risk.   The faculty and TAs actually seemed interested in integrating in-person teaching for fall 2021! They are intensely aware that students are miserable and suffering. There would be enough time and resources and hopefully even a portion of participants vaccinated by then for it to work. But it is now essentially November, and they are asking for in person teaching to be ready to go for January 4. It’s understandable that we’re excited to get back into it, but just not in this way and at this time.","Biology","albatrossalex","10/31/2020, 14:52:44","t3_jl4vf3","gapalzb"

"The high school and elementary school model is different then the university model. Grade schools are able to bubble and have one teacher to one class, or one classroom where teachers rotate. A lot of them are still at least 50% online, too with days or weeks on and off so that the volume of students in the building is reduced on any given day.  There's no way to do something like this in university for undergrads, even those in the same department have vastly different schedules. There's no way to bubble. If you can't bubble, you can't compare it to K-12.  Also if I have to guess, albatrossalex is using we because they were in the same meeting I was yesterday and the TAs/profs are pretty united in these statements. A good portion of the meeting was trying to figure out if/how the bio department could opt out of being in-person. There's also the added problem of like maybe it's a choice to go online or in person for undergrads but for us TAs is like hey surprise your class is in person so do you want to get COVID and pay rent or stay safe and have no guarantee of a position in the spring.","Biology","lithobius1814","10/31/2020, 18:15:44","t3_jl4vf3","gapwdva"

My instinct at this news was to be really happy about being able to get on campus again. My degree is literally stalled at the moment because I can’t get in the lab.  I mentioned in another comment but yes you’re right, this is the university listening to those paying for its services - arguably this is maybe a first for McGill. And again, the reaction would have been much more favourable if the in-person semester was Fall 2021, where people will be potentially be vaccinated and McGill has time to implement new safety measures. For January, they have November and half of December to figure it out, which is harsh and unrealistic.   About the returning to work thing, I think it’s because professors at universities consider themselves less “essential”. University isn’t mandatory, so I think they were collectively relieved that only elementary and high schools up to grade 10 had to go back to work. I think they feel a bit targeted now that they’re being told, rather than asked, to go to work.   And my apologies for offending you with the plague comment. It is, unfortunately, a word often used in describing covid-19 despite the worldwide “low IFR”. However, from the Québec viewpoint, we watched long term care homes get literally decimated.

"I hear you, but I also haven't bought a sandwich from a sandwich shop since Feb even through an app. I don't think you should have been forced to work then either. You can't assume the profs and TA's aren't thinking of the undergrads' health as well. Other universities around the globe have rolled out in person teaching with more resources, testing, and rules than McGill and its been a dismal failure.  Part of the problem is the mismatch between what the admin is telling us we're allowed to do research wise and what we're supposed to do teaching wise. They're saying it isn't safe for 2 people to be outdoors collecting samples together, it isn't safe for 2 people to be in the same lab at the same time even if they bubble or social distance, it isn't safe for one person to be alone in a room by themselves only working on a computer. This has had severe effects on research -- which brings in millions of dollars via grants and is directly related to the academic progress of grad students. Now we still can't do all of that but now teaching a room or lab full of undergrads is ok?  Like it or not McGill is a research university. Teaching undergrads isn't the only job profs and grad students have. We all want nothing more than to go back to normal and get back on campus (online teaching sucks as much as online learning) but the health and safety guidelines aren't there. Even if McGill loses some undergrad tuition, they're not exactly on the verge of financial ruin. The profs and their grad students bring in more than tuition via grant money in some departments... so demanding profs just suck it up and get back to teaching when it isn't actually necessary sounds like entitlement from this end, too.  Workers have rights. You don't have to lick your employer's boots and accept unsafe conditions.","Biology","lithobius1814","11/01/2020, 01:01:31","t3_jl4vf3","gar0twz"

Many, including me, arrived later than 9:30, so they don't have full 3-hr (Not to mention that entering the venue late is totally out of my control, as I did arrived early but was met with the abysmally long queue).  Also why would they hand out the exams for people entering the gym earlier when many others are still lining up at the entrance? Just to clarify, I don't have anything to do with those who started the exam early, as they're allowed to do so - the question is what made the school think that allowing some to start early is a good idea in the first place???","Computer Science","mfffeng","12/07/2021, 18:26:17","t3_rb084d","hnmdo4k"

"People in this thread are saying what mcgill should do, etc—but they won't apologize, this is admin! They should immediately move exams online for courses that have been online all semester. If they really want to hold all these exams in person, they should give up on the concept of distancing, have multiple entrances for students, and tell people to come at least 30 min early (sounds like y'all were waiting for more than that, and I'm so sorry that happened). Of course, if vaccination had already been mandatory and the school had that info on file in minerva or something, maybe a lot of the covid theatre that made everyone wait outside could be avoided.  What they should have done, and should do if they actually want to have this be fair to students, is **not start the exams until 80-90% of people are in there.** Does that mean that exams will start at 940, 240? Yeah. But tough shit, that's what it's like with covid right now. The fact that admin doesn't want to acknowledge the realities and did this is incredibly unfair.  I say this as a grad student who was an invigilator this morning; I have never seen anything so disorganized in my life, especially something as high stakes as this. What was particularly egregious was the fact that Math 140 looked mostly like U0/U1 students—experiences vary, of course, but the students in my rows looked caught off guard by how to use the answer sheets, bubble stuff in, didn't know to bring pencils, and were extremely stressed by how chaotic this morning was. And that's valid! Because it was the FIRST in-person exam McGill has done in 2 years, and they chose to make U0/U1 students into guinea pigs for something that fell apart almost immediately. Some students were on the verge of tears when they found out the exam started at 910 (when they arrived at 940), and frankly if it had been me, I would have been as well.   McGill admin failed from top to bottom bc I as an invigilator wasn't prepared to answer the questions asked of me (I wanted to, believe me—everyone deserved the 3 hours they were told they were gonna get) and students today were disrespected. Exams are tough enough without an admin that operates under a sense of delusion near constantly. I hope the next few days/weeks will be better, but if admin doesn't do anything, it honestly won't be. Come to your exams with a full water bottle, start your exam, and go to the bathroom once it starts if you need to, ask your invigilators questions about protocol, and leave early for exams if the lines continue like this. If you have other official outlets to complain, I highly recommend doing that as well.","English","fluffy_seaotter","12/08/2021, 01:46:59","t3_rb084d","hno0tyr"

There was a case in close contact with someone test covid 19 positive in McGill during in-person midterm season in McGill I think, and not to mention Omicron first 2 cases was found at Montreal and there are lots of proof on how 2-shot vaccination may not work to fully protect from it. My friend was in a class that had a covid-19 positive recently as well...  Vaccination is not perfect but it works well enough to justify having a semester mostly in person, which includes exams mostly in person.

"FWIW, McGill is tough both academically and mentally. I met with an alumnus 2 days ago who is now a Prof at Yale and she said that McGill really prepares you for the real world in the sense that the world doesn't care about you and you have to take care of yourself and go out of your way to get what you want. In that sense, you are more matured and independent than you’d think. (True story, the prof was approached by a Dean of students to cater to some girl who wants to defer an exam because she happens to be traveling somewhere for 2 weeks during the duration of the exam). The alumnus told me that Harvard and Yale students are a lot more entitled and catered to than those at McGill. With that said, we all know McGill could do better, especially on mental health services and other areas. As much as we love to complain about McGill, rest assured that we will graduate and come out stronger and more resilient.  As finals approach, take care of your mental health and talk to friends or family whenever you are feeling down. Good luck!

"When I did a few study aways (both irl and online) at Waterloo, weekly assignments were surprisingly normal and were made to force you to constantly practice the material before the midterm and final. I am not saying your feelings are invalid but I guess at McGill we're too used to just large weight few assessments rather than many small ones. I do agree though since McGill is JUST adjusting to that structure of assignment based learning now that it is poorly designed - when I did my assignments at Waterloo it did not feel as suffocating as it does now. The work was appropriately designed with adequate lecture time considering pedological purposes, I can't say the same here right now :(.

"I must admit that this is a great way to frame the problem with current education. The feeling that the material was extremely unengaging in entry level classes is something I can agree with; however, I can't help but get a feeling that you're in favor of a more elitist idea of higher education instead of having it open to more people just so your degree has more value.   As the technical needs of a society in its aggregate grows, should we not also expect the training of its constituency to increase as well? The crowding out effect is natural and in fact, I believe that it should be encouraged. The pool is indeed getting shallower. The value of your degree is in the scarcity of the owners. But what we should be paying attention to is that while the original pool was getting smaller, a new pool was dug.  There used to be a time when getting into high school was a massive achievement unfathomable to most. Then it became standard, and the new carrot on the stick became entering university. Now it's become an expectation to have a university degree. But that's not the end. Why don't we talk about Masters? What about PhDs?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I see your argument on the appeal of experiences outside of academia with regards to getting a job to be the same as the thought process behind ""how will I, someone with a high school terminal degree, distinguish myself from other high school alumni when searching for a job, since I'm not willing (or am not smart enough) to be a university grad competing against a high school alumnus?""  To be clear, I agree with your argument about the apparent loss in the value of a university terminal degree, but really, that's where it ends. The terminal degree has been pushed further as it should.","McGs to McDs","DreadedDream","09/27/2020, 06:35:18","t3_j0l56a","g6stajt"

"(I'm a U4) I was there the other day (not in Tipsy Cow but in Galleries du Parc) It's a bunch of first years having fun, and they are loud. Parc & Prince Arthur intersection is always loud though.   To me, the bigger problem is McGill letting people move into Rez. If they are renting out the double rooms in New Rez (I hope not), I honestly understand first years not caring about social distancing, they are literally sharing a room with a stranger.  I disagree with ""people in Montreal doing their best"" though. Have you been to St Laurent or Ste Catherine on a Friday in the last month? It's packed, you wouldn't believe we're going through a pandemic. My building has a mandatory mask rule and at least one-quarter of all the residents straight up refuse to wear one.  &#x200B;  "" SO I JUST REPORTED TIPSY COW AND NEW RESIDENCE FOR IGNORING & VIOLATING COVID HEALTH MEASURE.

"I hear you but I ultimately disagree. In my experience, those kinds of professors are not bad at conveying information, but rather design their assignments and exams to be much more difficult/convoluted than the level at which they teach the material. While I don't think this should be done for every class, having a handful of these hardcore classes interspersed throughout your bachelor's is quite beneficial imo.  These are the classes that make you grow and appreciate the intricacy of your field of study the most. Sure, it's not an enjoyable experience when you're in the thick of it. However, as a student at one of the world's top 50 universities, you're not paying for an enjoyable experience, you're paying for a top-tier education. Part of that is being confronted to difficulty and learning how to handle the stress, self-questioning, and occasional disappointment that comes with it.  Of course there are some caveats to these claims. For example, making an introductory course very difficult goes against the very purpose of the course by discouraging many potentially gifted students by challenging them too much too early.","Physics","French2Pac","07/15/2020, 17:32:47","t3_hrjl6a","fy5xlpw"
"I'm going to do my very best not to sound like a cursed boomer here but I'm sure this will still get downvoted to oblivion: I think OP's point is childish and indicative of a defeatist mindset. As someone who has had term GPA's ranging from 2.5-4 I've had this mindset before. I've been in classes where the prof has told me (to my face) and others to drop the class. If a prof tells you the material will be difficult, then view it as a challenge, because daunting as it may seem, an undergraduate class in any subject is never ""impossible"" for a student who is smart and mature enough. There's no shame in finishing with a bad grade as long as you tried your hardest. It may be that the class was in fact too hard for you (yes, such a think exists). That's not an intrinsic problem with the class or prof but instead a manifestation of the simple fact that only a small proportion of people are cut out for some things, and theres a chance you're not one of those people.   While a professor who cares about you is a wonderful thing to be cherished (s/o Pichot gang), a professor who doesn't isn't an ""entitled fuck."" They are a person who knows more about a very narrow subject than 99.999% of people on the earth and they are being asked to provide you with very basic information that you are meant to digest and internalize. Your inability to do so as a student doesn't reflect on the profs apparent unwillingness to hold your hand through the process. No matter how difficult the class, there are always kids who do well - because they are exemplary students who by definition will succeed irrespective of the quality of the teacher. If you are not one such student then that's ok, just don't expect a 4.0 GPA. I've fully accepted that I'm not a 4.0 student, and that's ok just as long as I do my best. If I fail math 576 this fall then I will have done so because I am not good enough at topology, not because Dani Wise is a big bad evil man - even though I know that the first thing he'll say in the first lecture is that many of us will be dropping the class.

"I disagree, the prof clearly cares deeply about student success and the class average is consistently a B+ for PHYS 101, and a B for PHYS 131. He does not brag about it being a difficult class, and actually is outspoken about it being a class with many resources (FrezCa, his lectures, TEAM mentors, the textbook, CAPA, clicker questions, etc) for success. He is also a passionate educator and explains concepts clearly. He provides many past exams to study from, and reuses questions from them and in class clickers. On top of all that, he scales grades generously at the end of the semester.

"I don't think he's proud that the averages are low. They just happen to be low because they're challenging exams, I didn't do fantastic on them and some of the things you have to assume are weird but overall they're not unreasonable. I think if a class happened to get a high average on one, he would actually be very happy and proud of his students. He is very clear from the beginning of the class that the exam questions are similar to the CAPA challenge questions, but that's because he wants students to go beyond simply memorizing how to do a question, and instead actually understand the material - nothing is out of the scope of the course in my opinion. Sure, I'd love if he gave harder normal CAPA questions to prepare us, but people would no doubt complain about that too. Literally at least one or two questions on each exam is a direct rip off of a CAPA challenge, people are just chapped because those specific problems aren't required homework.   He also gives tons of opportunities to get help and succeed like bonus marks, FrezCa, office hours, questions after class, ect, and scales grades when necessary because he understands that getting shit mark for a class you understand isn't gonna help anyone.  I just feel like its unfair to say that just because he's a classic physics professor who shits on life science and engineering as a joke, doesn't mean that he doesn't care about his students or is dismissive of their success. Obviously he knows theres a lot of hopeful future med students because it's a class for mostly life science students (PHYS 101) and a lot of biology undergrads hope to do medicine one day. I feel like those comments aren't about his class but more about how many people go into their undergrad thinking they want to go to med school before they see the vast amount of career options in STEM.","Earth Systems and Procrastination","canoegay","07/16/2020, 04:58:12","t3_hrjl6a","fy822tr"

"I definitely agree with you on points 1-8 (I could maybe quibble some of the wording, but I'm on board with the general idea of all of them).   On the other hand, we might not see eye to eye on the following two points:  * I think it would still be beneficial to have one of these hard classes be mandatory for most majors (I would say all, but I'm sure there are reasonable boundary cases that I'm not considering).  Pretty much everyone would benefit from being challenged at this level during their education.  By 'hard', I mean that only a minute portion of enrolled students get an A/A-; not 'impossible to pass'.  * Not doing well in a class related to a topic that one is already familiar with and that one enjoys shouldn't discourage anyone from pursuing their studies on that subject as a whole. If it does, then one should question why they enjoy studying this topic in the first place.  I know this second point sounds heartless, but I'll elaborate on why it's important. IME, many in their undergrad (myself included, to a certain extent) aren't fully sure what they want to do with their lives and don't really have a strong reason behind their choice of major beyond general interest (which is fine). One reason people enjoy studying a given subject is because they are successful in doing so (i.e. they get good grades) and thus have a positive reinforcement loop that keeps them engaged.   However, if they lose their passion for the subject upon receiving a low mark, then maybe being good at that subject was the only real reason for their interest in it. In that case, being awoken to that fact early in their life spares them from being disillusioned further down the road, when they'll have made certain life choices (e.g. applying to grad school) with the underlying assumption that they are truly passionate about said subject.  I also want to add that realising that one isn't ~passionate~ about a field of study doesn't mean they should switch majors or drop out; most graduates get jobs that have very little to do with what they studided during their bachelor's degree. This realisation should just help them orient themselves towards the career path that is most fulfilling for them.","Physics","French2Pac","07/15/2020, 18:42:24","t3_hrjl6a","fy66jlp"
"This is complete BS. I've been a TEAM mentor for PHYS 101/131 for the past 3 years and Ragan has shown time and time again how much he cares about teaching and improving his methods for educating students. In fact, I can say from experience that Ragan is one of the few profs I've had who actually seems to enjoy teaching, much more than many of the upper year life sci profs who mostly just teach so they can get back to their research. With Ragan's experience at McGill, he doesn't have to teach one of the largest freshman classes of he doesn't want to. He CHOOSES to teach it and tries to make the physics in the course as accessible as possible.  Phys 101 can be a challenging course, but its not impossible to do well. There are so many resources for students and there's no-one to blame but yourself for not doing well (phys 131 is another story but thats to prep people for more physics and maths intensive degrees).  Ragan doesn't have a dismissive attitude towards students with med school dreams. If you can't make it through phys101, then you're probably not gonna make it though the rest of your upper year courses with an average thats competitive for med.

"SSRIs are not a magic bullet.   They take at least a month to work and the dosage needs to be increased over time, and the patient might need to discontinue treatment due to side effects.   In my experience, I took one antidepressant which made me bitchy and irritable and a terror to be around. I was on it for 6 months.   Then I switched to a second antidepressant, which made me almost normal except for the fact that I couldn't...reach the top of the mountain, if you know what I mean. That took around 6 months to get off of, because I was having to weigh having a sex life or being depressed.   I chose option C, as in, try a third antidepressant, which was actually an SNRI. That one worked better than the other two, but it's expensive. It costs $127 a month with RAMQ, and I'm still dealing with bouts of severe depression.   This is an example of the kind of shit people with depression have to deal with. It's not as easy as that.   I exercise regularly, I eat three meals a day (or two, whatever I'm still a student), and I take antidepressants. I'm still depressed. I hope to *god* that you aren't in psych, because if you think it's that easy to deal with depression, you are misinformed.","German Studies & PoliSci Nut","Razwog","12/03/2020, 08:45:00","t3_k548ef","gegxk86"
"Your approach is pretty reductive of mental health issues that students face.   I have a decent GPA, and I've been exercising and eating enough. I'm literally in better shape than I've been before the pandemic.   Guess what? I'm depressed as hell, even while taking the maximum dosage of designer antidepressants that cost $127 dollars a MONTH with RAMQ insurance. Depression does NOT listen to logic or reason, and it doesn't need to have an underlying cause.   SSRIs are not a magic bullet. SNRIs are not a magic bullet. Even CBT is not a magic bullet, though most students don't have the dough to drop the big bucks on therapists every week or every second week anyhow. Sometimes the biggest victory of the day is showering or eating or getting out of bed, and that's fine. That's the nature of the beast.   Your attitude of ""breaking the cycle"" yadda yadda is just annoying and places blame on the person dealing with depression, when people with depression already beat themselves up for not ""breaking the cycle"" or finding the ""underlying cause"" to their depression.   Sometimes there isn't one.   I'm guessing you don't have a mental health background, so I'd err on the side of caution and aim for a compassionate tone when talking to people who are dealing with a mental health crisis instead of trying to give people advice on how to handle it.   Saying that you ""Dealt with depression"" doesn't mean squat. Depression comes in so many different forms with so many different levels of severity. What you may think was your worst depressive episode might be a good day for OP. Some depressive episodes can only be handled with medication rather than therapy or logic, and even people in the field of mental health recognize this fact.   There are people who study mental health for years and can't easily address a patient's depression even with full knowledge of their medical history and background, so maybe you shouldn't try with a Reddit comment and aim for compassion.","German Studies & PoliSci Nut","Razwog","12/03/2020, 08:31:46","t3_k548ef","gegwsdq"

"Everybody = Government is the definition of a fair system, minus majoritarianism. Marx, Engel, Bakunin, Proudhon, Rocker and others have discussed the ways to avoid majoritarianism in detail.  I don't see any points of contradiction in the meme. There is no reason to assume that Quebec (or Canada) is remotely socialist in its architecture. Nor to assume that this ban is driven by socialist concerns. For all we know this is about tenders and who gets to make money off of what. Or perhaps there are health concerns that are exaggerated. I don't have all the information so I can't make a claim.  As for the meme, it is merely an expression of public dissatisfaction with top-down imposition of authority. Marx was vehemently opposed to such hierarchies. Try David Harvey's book.","Cognitive Science","biolinguist","10/24/2019, 18:06:09","t3_dm6ywh","f51f49z"

"If you're touching the mask and adjusting it too much, then it's still useless. There's a reason people are trained to use N95 respirators properly. The act of touching your own mask/readjusting it, especially when it is as flimsy as a surgeons mask, can be just as problematic as touching your face.   Reusable masks/surgeon's masks are not N95s, they will not prevent the spread of coronavirus. The impact is negligible. Even if you're reusing the mask--if you handle it incorrectly, then the mask becomes contaminated, etc.  There's a reason people have been quarantined inside (in Italy etc) instead of using those crap masks to walk around.

"Well, the way I cook for myself during crunch times is in massive batches.   You can easily make a bomb spaghetti sauce in a massive batch (you can literally end up freezing a good chunk of your sauce if you have the freezer space). You can actually [freeze the sauce into ice-cube trays]( to make it super easy to defrost at a whim.   Then all you need to do is defrost the sauce and make some pasta and whammo, you've got a solid meal.   If you don't have loads of freezer space, you can just cook up a massive batch of spaghetti bolognese and eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Btw, if you're vegetarian you can absolutely still survive on spaghetti sauce, as long as you add lotsa cheese and stuff.    The other thing that can be done in massive batches is [fried rice.](  Then there's eggs. Eggs are so versatile. It takes minutes to cook up some scrambled eggs, and you can buy frozen hash browns in bulk from the store (which you can then put in a toaster oven), then have bread with it...and bam, that's a full dope breakfast in 15 minutes that won't mess up your kitchen much. **You can eat breakfast for dinner as well :D**  If you're feeling really, really pressed for time and find yourself ordering on ubereats, just buy frozen pizzas that are high quality with the expectation that you'll have a meltdown at some point. Even if they end up being pricier than normal, there won't be any delivery time and it'll end up being really tasty.","German Studies & PoliSci Nut","Razwog","03/22/2021, 21:29:19","t3_maxvph","gruwf8z"

If you know this recipe already, you can ignore me, but this might be great for other students who are in a time crunch.    **Spaghetti alio e olio**  The ingredients required:   *  parmesan (yes I know, but its still cheaper than ordering in)  * pasta,   * garlic,  * fresh or dried parsley,   * chili flakes,   * butter,   * olive oil  * lemon/lemon juice.  **Step 1:** Start boiling water (throw in a lot of salt, tho that's obvious)  **Step 2:** As the water is slowwwwly coming to a boil, mince 2/3rds of a head of garlic (traditionalists say you're supposed to slice the garlic thin, but fuck em, my way is better) >:C  **Step 3:** Put a pan on medium heat. Put olive oil and butter into the pan (I eyeball the amounts, but if you like a recipe, [here you go]( then yeet all the garlic in. Traditionalists say ""only olive oil belongs in that pan"" but fuck em, my way is better >:C.  Butter turns the olive oil and garlic mixture saucy through the process of emulsification, and that's what you want.   **Step 4:** As the garlic starts to become golden, yeet in red chili flakes (don't throw in too many, oil makes chili flakes spicier and more aromatic) along with some pepper. Remember that you want to take the oil+butter+spices+garlic mixture off the heat a smidge before the garlic gets too toasty, because it'll continue cooking in the residual heat of the pan.   **Step 5:** By now your pasta is probably done. Strain that bitch, but leave enough pasta water to add to the pan (you can add around tablespoon of pasta water). Now you add the pasta to the pan with the sauce you've made, then throw in half a cup of parmesan.   **Step 6:** Now your spaghetti alio e olio is probably looking pretty dank but a bit monochromatic. Throw dried pre-chopped parsley on top of the pasta if you want to convince yourself that you've added parsley/greenery to your meal (people will say dried parsley has almost no flavor, and they're right, but we eat with our fuckin' eyes). Fresh parsley is always better, but what the hell is this, Buckingham palace?   **Step 7:** Do you have lemon juice? Dope, throw some lemon juice in the pasta to make it pop even more. I'm not saying you need to add a lemonaide stand's worth, but a drizzle will make it taste so good. If you have an actual honest to god lemon, get a grater and zest 1/3rd to 1/2th of the lemon's rind into the saucey pasta mix to lift the pasta into ""you're a fucking god"" territory. Still, that's optional.   The way I wrote that out makes it sound complex, but it's really not. It's only 30 minutes of work if you've got all the ingredients. You can use it to impress dates, or yourself quite honestly. I've also done the napkin math and its not super duper pricey, since the main cost is the parmesan and garlic.    If you're a visual learner, this youtuber is [dank and has a great recipe.](","German Studies & PoliSci Nut","Razwog","03/23/2021, 01:35:42","t3_maxvph","grvpsf7"

"At some point I’ll fail to stop myself from at least renting one for a week. But deep down I’m still hoping that the R3 release drives down the price of the R5/R6.   How’s that vari-aperture on the lens? Does it get in the way? I have a Sigma 150-600 and the variable aperture is really annoying sometimes.","McGill Flying Club","light_blue_yonder","09/08/2021, 03:10:50","t3_pjzxua","hc0kj8n"
"Oh, I highly recommend you try out the R5/R6. The R5 has made me a true convert to mirrorless systems. I had my doubts before about the EVF. And based on what I've heard about the original R, not to mention many other brands' cameras (older generations), I think they were warranted. But the R5 and R6 make the EVF so smooth and so natural that it feels just like an optical viewfinder, but better. Exposure preview, the enhanced AF abilities, even MF assist --- all that stuff is super neat to have. A creature comfort is that I can just hit the playback button and review my shots in the viewfinder! Way better than whipping out the screen. Besides the mirrorless aspect, of course, the R5 and R6 are excellent image producers --- and IBIS is also great to have, especially when you double it up with an already-stabilized lens. Great for handheld shots (like all of these).  I somewhat doubt the R3 will significantly bring down the price of the R5 or R6. Time will, of course, as it always does, but the R3 just doesn't do the same stuff as the R5. It's going to be significantly more niche, I think, and the pixel-peepers and crop demons will take the R5 still because it's got more megapixelage. The R3 is really great for pro sports photogs who really need 30 fps instead of the 20 you get with the R5. (That's why R3 preprod units have been used at the Olympics alongside the 1DX Mark III.) Yes, the whole thing is very technologically exciting, with the stacked CMOS sensor. But unless you're shooting that fast --- and you're probably not --- you probably still go for the R5 or R6. What I think will lower the R5's price at some point is the rumored R5s (which is supposed to be 90MP, or 100MP, or 70MP, or something --- who knows, it's a rumor) --- but that's a ways away.  I don't really mind the vari-aperture, although I'm pretty fast to adjust it (and speed/ISO) as I see fit, so I don't really have any issues generally. Of course, if you like the whole aperture ring concept, you can set the RF control ring to aperture.  That Sigma 150-600 is a monster of a lens! Would love to try it out. (By the way, EF lenses work just as well as before, if not even better, on the R5/R6: just add the non-optical adapter and the cameras already speak EF lenses' native language.) The 100-500 is great, and a bit smaller too, so it fits better in my bag, although your lens is a bit faster for the most part. I've always loved telephoto lenses.","novus alumnus, quasi vetus","BeckoningVoice","09/08/2021, 03:57:37","t3_pjzxua","hc0ppj0"
"Oh wow, thanks for the VERY detailed reply!  I'm mostly a plane spotter who only conforms his gear to other photography tasks as best as possible, rather than the other way around. The 100-600mm is just too heavy. The aperture is already quite slow for a lot of the low-light fast-paced photography. I worked the entire [London Airshow evening show]( with my 70-200 f/2.8L IS because of that. and realistically, only the EF 100-400mm L lens fits my telephoto needs, but you know, $5000 and all that... I'm caught in a dilemma whether to go full-frame first or get the 400mm L lens first.","McGill Flying Club","light_blue_yonder","09/08/2021, 22:22:17","t3_pjzxua","hc433eu"
"The RF 100-500 is the successor to the EF 100-400, so you'd get pretty similar results from both. They're also both the same physical size (about 80% the size of your Sigma lens). That being said, the RF 100-500 does get slower slightly quicker for the most part (it's a touch slower at 400 than its EF predecessor). If you really need a speedy lens, though, this isn't going to be the ticket.  Is it better than the Sigma you have? Overall, yes, but it's not gonna be from speed. For what you want to do, you need to either (1) crank the ISO or (2) buy a fast telephoto prime (will give you a great picture for only like $15k!).  If you're shooting APS-C, and you want to use Canon ... going mirrorless (if you want to shoot on APS-C crop mode) is only going to be an upgrade if you go for the R5 which will give you results similar to the 7D Mark II, as it's very slightly less resolution than that, but newer and better high ISO performance (not to mention generally better IQ and AF). The R6... I mean, the IQ will be similar, but crop mode photos will be too small imo.  I shoot almost all in FF rather than crop mode (can do cropping in post ofc). This is great, and for this the R5 is only matched by the 5DS in the Canon DSLR space (which has very slightly higher resolution but slightly inferior IQ). But if you shoot FF and want to really take advantage of the camera for the same aerial shoots you'd need an even LONGER telephoto lens, and that would necessarily be a fast prime. And frankly without $20-30k and a back made of steel you're not getting that.

My impostor syndrome went away for good the day I found out I could literally get out of a graduation requirement by asking my department adviser nicely. Turned out she had the discretion to do that and had no reason not to, it's not like they take it out of her paycheck. Just today I found a great research opportunity, but the deadline was last week. Whatever, I emailed the prof and apologized for being late. He told me he'd only gotten two applications and was happy to consider someone else. You have power over other people. Use it!

"For the Law Library, I don’t think the entire library is restricted to Law students around exam time - iirc it’s only a couple of floors. That being said, I haven’t been there since the Before Times so things may have changed since.   There’s some kind of glass-walled silent study room in an upper floor of Burnside that’s just for Math students.  Correction for Leacock too - there are some study rooms with restaurant-style booths on the west side of the first floor. There are also some semi-closed carrels with a door in these rooms that are used for TA office hours - when they’re not booked, anyone can use them.  Arts basement has a bank of seats near Subway (this space can briefly be seen in X-Men: Days of Future Past when they’re in the Pentagon).   The Leacock and Arts spaces are especially useful if you’re waiting between lectures in LEA132.","Not an authority figure '20","CatanOverlord","08/23/2021, 20:11:01","t3_pa2jlt","ha2oqcx"

"Bronfman has some pretty nice study space both in the basement and the second floor (I think) that can be accessed by anyone during the day.  Don’t overlook Redpath ! McClennan’s 6 floors definitely have a certain imposing allure, but turn away from the elevators and take that hallway on the right to Redpath, and then go up a floor or two (elevators and stairs will be on the left side of the hallway). You’ll find some nice study spaces and a few hidden nooks too. Redpath is one of those areas that is worthwhile to explore.   There’s a student lounge in Morrice Hall (Islamic Studies building) on the 3rd floor. It’s pretty cozy, and generally pretty uninhabited. I spent almost all of my 4 years in that lounge. Just make sure you enter the building from the side door (the door that faces the Y) rather than the main library doors (that face Leacock) so you can take the elevator up. Also, there’s a tunnel that connects Morrice Hall and Leacock — the door to the tunnel sort of faces the elevator in Morrice at a diagonal.   I’m pretty sure there’s a secret English department lounge in the basement of the Arts building. I’ve never gone in, but it seemed quiet, dark, and deserted, and might be a good place to nap.","Economics and Hindi","sabsixx","08/24/2021, 04:01:34","t3_pa2jlt","ha4ewyi"

Imagine getting an undercooked piece of meat, and not telling the staff. This is even more serious, since it is our health. While doctors are a source of reputable information, by no rights should we completely surrender our agency to them.   Mcgill wellness hub is trash beyond measure.

A man came running out after her with a large knife, jumped on top of her, and started stabbing her. As he was doing it, apparently he continued saying, ""im sorry I have to do this.""

"Hello, I noticed you're getting a lot of great advice, but I don't want you to get stuck on decision paralysis. You may just want a simple plan of action starting right now, so I have written one out for you below.   **STEP 1 Tonight -- immediate need**: get in touch with keep.meSAFE ""free, confidential, 24/7 professional counselling service available to all McGill students, regardless of location. Download the MySSP app and chat or call for same-day support and/or appointment-based support."" **Goal**: to take the first step, perhaps get a few moments of relief from loneliness and distress, and a bit of energy and resolve to endure.   **STEP 2 Tomorrow -- rest and make a plan**: if you want, reach out the the same crisis line or try a new one. Commit to going to the clinic tomorrow and visualize it.  **Goal**: to regroup and focus (to whatever extent possible)  **Step 3 Monday -- get help**: You will go visit McGill Psychiatric Services (514-398-6019), which has safety appointments Monday to Friday 11:00 - 13:00 offered on a first-come, first served basis. **Goal**: To get onto a path of long term care solutions.

"Hey, I'm sorry to hear you're having a rough time. I don't know if this is a rant post or a request for help, but just to deal with some logistical things (I'll pin a comment with links to these things in a few minutes):  * If you want to talk to someone, you can book a slot with Vent Over Tea, which is basically just a person talking to you about whatever you want for an hour. There's also McGill's Peer Support Centre, which does active listening sessions, and Nightline if you're struggling mentally and need some support. * If you're about to run out for medications, the pharmacist can renew them temporarily until you get an appointment with your doctor. This might not work if it already ran out a while ago, but you can ask. * You family doctor can write you a referral to a psychiatrist (which you usually don't need an appointment for), and then you can see a psychiatrist through McGill. You can also make an appointment at any other clinic if you want. You can also get free counselling whenever you want (like, right now if you choose) through the keep.meSAFE app. It's paid for in your student fees.  * If you're looking for friends, you can join almost any club at McGill any time you want. Obviously there's no guarantee, but a lot of people make friends through that.","hit rocket bottom","snowflake25911","10/31/2021, 02:03:58","t3_qjfii7","hipu4sh"

"Hi,  People here have already given great resources, so I won't add to that, but I just wanted to say that for 3.5 years, I have had very few friends I interact with as well, pretty much just my roommate. When I got so lonely I couldn't stand it, I went to discord and was able to find people I clicked with. There are discords for several McGill clubs, like the anime club, and you can search for other servers that match your interests. You don't even have to voice chat to get satisfying social interaction. The more niche the server the better.  This just worked for me, maybe you could try it too. I wish you the absolute best.","Cloudberry stan","ship-wrecks","10/31/2021, 02:58:56","t3_qjfii7","hiq0ce1"
"I know things seem hopeless right now and COVID is just making it even worse but I am begging you to hold on and keep on pushing through! I went through the exact same thing as you in my first year and I swear things get better!  Coming to McGill and growing up in general comes with the realization that nothings going to change unless you have a hand in it. I myself still haven’t managed to make friends but I’ve gotten stable footing on other parts of my life and that’s better than nothing. Pls pls pls try and find a psychiatrist to see ASAP even if it’s not your usual because things will seem so much more manageable once your meds are sorted out!   just focus on eating well, getting sleep and so long as you make and try to achieve just ONE small goal a day (even if it’s just making your bed) you’ll feel a lot better about your day!  Also, I found that trying hobbies I may find fun helped a lot and could even come with opportunities to make friends (try reading clubs, pottery, archery, etc even if it’s something not offered at mcgill)!  Most importantly, you matter please don’t give up - hope comes from within you just need to be easy on yourself and find reason to carry on to the next day even it’s it’s for reasons as small as seeing the sun shine. Let me know if I can help at all and happy Halloween :)","Responsible for the Gerts delays","big-misssteak","10/31/2021, 02:01:51","t3_qjfii7","hiptw6j"

"mcgill actually has group therapy and I think even some clubs that relate to all things eating disorders and I think it could be really valuable to try to connect with them because eating in times of stress and panic attacks is a really tough issue to tackle and having a shoulder to lean on or even a counsellor could help! If not, making an appointment with a wellness counsellor in your department should be much easier and quicker to access than a psychiatrist just in the short term!   Like other commenters noted, there’s quite a few walk in clinics besides McGill’s that can see you within the same day and either get a psychiatrist referral (which you can use to see a psychiatrist at mcgill within less than a month) or just refill ur meds.  Lastly, i think a solid option would be to talk to your stepfather and be brutally honest about how your feeling even if this means he may be upset for a bit. If you need time to relax and just breathe I STRONGLY URGE you apply for a leave of absence (I believe it’s all online and it’s a fairly straightforward process) and go home for a semester.  Being out on the streets or in a shelter is just going to aggravate your mental state and if you think housing is too difficult to arrange than you need to consider going home ASAP! even if you miss a lab or assignment, consider going home for a few weeks now and just schedule a zoom meeting with your advisor to ask how you can take some time off!   There are always resources and all the wonderful programs the mod commented as well as your advisor are your best bet to figuring out a solid plan with the help of others","Responsible for the Gerts delays","big-misssteak","10/31/2021, 02:35:07","t3_qjfii7","hipxog5"

"I think a simpler explanation is that averages were really high last semester and most profs were okay with an average being high in the middle of a worldwide crisis for a semester. However, as it became obvious that this was going to last at least two more semesters, profs started to think about a way to keep students accountable now that exams couldn't be used for that purpose.  In the past, if you did no work all semester, you would face risk of failing the final. In a world without real finals, the only way to ""reward"" students for working is to have regular small assessments. This will on average represent more work for both students and profs but it has the upside of giving the students opportunities to earn grades.  An argument could be made on the idea that during a pandemic, grades shouldn't matter at all and it wouldn't be an issue if everyone had an A, but while I don't think that's a stupid argument, I don't really agree with it because the whole academic system works based on GPA and giving everyone high GPAs for 3 semesters (which at mcgill represents near a half degree on average) would make high GPAs achieved before the pandemic near-meaningless. I do understand that there are pros and cons though. Note that the workload didn't change much in departments that weren't super focused on final exams, so Arts students will have seen less change than science students.  (for the record I don't really have a horse in this debate because my GPA hasn't mattered in 5 years)","snowflake changed my flair","Thermidorien","09/15/2020, 04:18:40","t3_it0mzx","g5bp3ih"

"I get like 14,000 in bursary with no repayment plus like 5000 in loan with repayment starting some number of months after the end of my degree each year. You get more for doing more credits (we do ~50 per year so it gives a lot). Based on conversations ive had with out of province students who are not eligible, it is much better than similar programs from other provinces.  It is also very important to mention that there is a number of conditions (having a bachelors degree, being in continuing education, living alone for x years, parents deceased, etc), which are major determinants on the amount of money they give. If you fulfill one if these condition, your parents have no contribution. Otherwise, your parents are expected to contribute a portion based on their salary, and the government pays that much less.  Also, if you work during school above a certain amount of money per year, you are expected to contribute, but your contribution is generally small unless you earn an insane amount for a student.  Overall, as a student who doesn’t earn a lot from work and who has a bachelors degree, I find it very generous.","Medicine","0wnzl1f3","06/04/2021, 01:37:52","t3_nrgpku","h0iioqu"

"Depending on your situation it may or may not be. After checking my account, the debt limit is in reference to the actual loan and does not include the bursary portion, so they provide you with more than $30,000 total. There is nothing that is stopping you from receiving more money from other sources. In some cases, other money will decrease the amount of the bursary portion and in other cases, the bursary is not affected. For example, RESP is exempt from the calculations of the bursary. There is also IIRC like a $5,000 buffer on other bursaries or scholarships. Like in my case, I received a $6,000 grant during my first AFE year, and $5,000 of it was exempt from the AFE calculations. In any event, unless you plan to take another degree (there is a month limit and in a second degree, there would be no parental contribution because you have a bachelor's degree, so you would get more money), there is no reason not to apply for AFE.","Medicine","0wnzl1f3","06/04/2021, 04:18:46","t3_nrgpku","h0j1p7w"
"> Anyone also feel like they’ve just gotten dumber over the year? Like worse at writing, worse study habits, worse work ethic, worse everything.  To answer your question... Yes. Absolutely. Indubitably. My brain has a case of the Big Dumb, and I can't work like I normally do.   I think that there is an undeniable reality here--with this online university shit, it's hard to get and stay motivated (and it wasn't like I was high functioning busy beaver before COVID!). Going to campus, competing with keeners, and freaking out as a group in Redpath/Schulich gave my shriveled, gay, cherry-pit-sized-heart a lil' more life.   Humans are social animals. Without social interaction, we end up slowly losing our goddamn mind. There's a reason NASA trains its astronauts on how to deal with people when they have psychotic episodes--confined spaces and only socializing with the same people every day has a significant impact, even if you've had loads of healthy coping mechanisms instilled in you through top of the line training regimens.   It doesn't mean we should start organizing fight clubs and breathing all over each other bEcAuSe mEnTaL HeAltH, but we should at least cut ourselves some slack. We aren't gonna be firing on eight cylinders, or six, or even four depending on how well we deal with this unique and shitty situation...and that's OK.   I do not think we're going to maintain this brain foggy feeling once Brick and Mortar University begins again.

Its actually happened at McGill were a prof didn’t believe ADHD was real and then intentionally made my life difficult/tried to fail me (I did try to pursue this but her superior was just and aged version of my evil prof so nothing could be done). Now that it’s been years and every prof since has been nothing but nice about it, I’ve finally started to realize that I was just uniquely unfortunate.

"Government funding has been going down rather regularly ever since the 2012 student strike, and McGill has offloaded the costs onto students, particularly undergrads, by cutting their own participation in the funding of several services (while also cutting down their operations as well), and cutting down into ""non-profitable"" departments / increasing student per TA ratio, etc, leaving SSMU to scramble to gap the holes. Several campus press/groups worked to highlight this between 2014 and 2017, not sure if the reports are still available tho.   They recently won a ""victory"" by gaining the right to deregulate international student fees tho, not like it led to any qualitative change into the situation (nor that it is fair in any way either).   Meanwhile McGill admin makes it a pride to go suck up to the worst corporate and state actors of the world in Davos to rake in some precious donations and investment agreements, anyone who thinks grad donations has the slightest capacity to switch the shitty choices of admin are deluding themselves, the scales of donations are no where near each other regardless.   Donations (and forced dependence on that latter) go hand in hand with deregulations, and in turn ties the uni to private interests, its rather obvious.

"> Why do you take what I say and make it so distorted? I never said that gay people were stalkers, but it would be a question of gayness simply because it was two males in the situation.  Your hypothetical had no bearing on this situation, and you brought gay dudes into it for no reason. That was my point.  > It doesn’t matter who it is, just that we should be **rational in ambiguous situations**.  Interesting. That conflicts with your first comment.   >Maybe he just wanted to be friends, no need to be so paranoid. I don’t think he was trying to kill you  Nothing about that response is rational. You're unironically telling a woman who was stalked that they're just being paranoid, while also baselessly saying ""I don't think he was trying to kill you.""   If you don't want women to end up in situations where they might need to defend themselves and potentially get into legal trouble because of it, guess what? The caution that you dismiss as 'paranoia' is absolutely CRUCIAL to avoiding confrontations that could get violent.   >maybe carrying bearspray or kicking as was definitely suggested (go look) is actually terrible advice  Stop moving the goalposts of your terrible arguments based off the downvoted claims of two people on this thread.    > I care about everybody’s wellbeing and dignity for the most part, and I don’t want the situation to turn violent unnecessarily.

The fact that there is resistance to change is always going to lead some people to claim that the people asking for that change are ""violent"" or ""have disregard for peace / order"".   It's really just a consequence of social change and it shouldn't really stop people from raising their voices about issues they care about.   That being said, some people are not comfortable going out to protest given the pandemic and that's fine IMO - there's a lot of good work to be done by mobilizing people on social media platforms.   At the end of the day not everyone has to be an staunch advocate for every issue, but, I think most decent human beings would agree that we are better when we are diverse and that real diversity comes when everyone feels safe. As long as we all espouse that belief and spread it, we can start to see some real change :)","✅ Competitive Programming '20","Im_so_mad_bro","03/20/2021, 19:46:19","t3_m99gxo","grmdxg4"

"There's absolutely no reason to think it wasn't motivated by both anti-Asian racism and fundamentalist Christian beliefs on sex and sex work.  >It just so happens, and it is unfortunate, that most prostitution massage parlors in the US are owned and operated by Asian Americans and Asians tricked into sex slavery.  It doesn't ""just so happen"" to be this way: there is a long history of Asians being trafficked and sexually fetishized in Western countries. What I'm saying here is that it's impossible to disentangle the anti-Asian and anti-sex work elements when it comes to the motivation of this shooting.  Same thing goes for Pulse.

You're entering into the muddled land of proving negatives.  So you're advising people to be careful with drawing conclusions based on things that didn't happen.  > The outcome would have been the exact same if the parlors were run and operated by whites or blacks or latinos.

"> Neither, it was religiously motivated. The shooter targeted the (White) male patrons of the establishments as well. Remember when Trump made it a point in '16 to repeat ""Radical Islamic Terrorism""? This is a textbook case of Radical Christian Terrorism. Yet noone in the media is calling it that, sadly  Have you considered the possibility that if the entirety of the media disagrees with you and claims there is a gender component and a racial component in the murder, that means there's a slight possibility of you being wrong? Or do you just naturally assume that everyone else is wrong whenever you're really convinced of something?  You've never commented on this subreddit so from the perspective of people here you just kind of walked up in here to explain to us that you know exactly what this crime was about and you're not bringing in any kind of source, documentation or credibility to back that up.","snowflake changed my flair","Thermidorien","03/21/2021, 23:43:06","t3_m99gxo","grr74y7"

You mention assessing evidence and thinking critically but as far as we are concerned you are talking out of your ass at the moment.  > They claimed this because politicians were claiming it for political reasons. Same thing in this case. Just because some group of politicians and their media mouthpiece say something, it doesnt mean Im going to take it as gospel, I am going to assess the available evidence and use critical thinking.

"The Pulse nightclub shooter did not leave a manifesto, so a full psychological profile of the shooter is murky. The fact of the matter is, when someone goes into a gay bar, murders 50 people and wounds 53 others, well... it's a fair assumption to make that it was a hate crime with a homophobic element.   That's why the media reported it as a hate crime. On top of that, queer people are targeted all the time. It's part of a [pattern]( Even in Montreal, I was once chased by some dudes with my boyfriend, and we had to book it.

"> The perp in the Atlanta case was a frequent customer of the rub n tugs, was deeply ashamed of this due to his Baptist upbringing, and had recently been sent to Bible camp in order to cast out these demons. He admitted to police that he was motivated by the shame brought on by his ""sexual addiction"" and he saw this attack as a way to exorcise that. This is my backup for the position I am taking. The media's backup for their consensus position is ""Trump bad""  So let me get this straight. You literally just told a user that the gender and race of the victims had nothing to do with the crime... and you're justifying this by the evidence that his motive was, at the core, deep shame from being addicted to sex with.... asian women. Which prompted him to attack massage parlors and kill .... people he was deeply ashamed of being addicted to having sex with.   But the murder has nothing to do with gender OR race, and the media are only bringing these elements, which have absolutely nothing to do with the crime, into the story because they want to recuperate it to criticize Trump.  If that's the result of your critical thinking efforts you might want to go back to the drawing table. FYI, when people ask you to bring in evidence to support your claims, the evidence needs to actually support the claim you are using it for, otherwise it kind of defeats the point.","snowflake changed my flair","Thermidorien","03/22/2021, 00:46:56","t3_m99gxo","grrejif"

"Hi, don't have my flair yet but SSMU VP Finance here. Can't believe that the first reddit post re: my portfolio is a BS fine from the City but hey. The SSMU will be covering the cost of this group's fine. We don't know the final cost yet but as per the city's regulations it could be as low as $2,250 or as high as $54,000 *(Yikes, I fucking hope not)*. I'll also be writing in campus publications the details of what was cited this week.  From talking with our staff who've worked in restaurant/food management during their careers, I would expect more inspections over the course of this week, and strongly encourage groups not to hold food sales right now. We are working to put procedures in place and provide resources so that groups can continue to sell samosas/other foodstuffs on campus, as well as using our not-for-profit status to apply for a new food permit for groups. That being said, this will take some time to put in place - specifically one of the requirements that was cited in the fine notice  (and touched on here) was that Samosas must be stored and served at above 60 degrees C at all times.  &#x200B;  edit: I have a flair now","SSMU VP Finance ✅","englishmaninohio","10/23/2019, 02:00:09","t3_dlrxzr","f4tzytt"
"So this was my club and essentially what happened was the guy shut us down and threatened a 200-300 dollar fine (which wasn't actually issued). Then we got into a little argument with him and he asked for the number of our supervisor. We gave them SSMU's number and a guy from ssmu came (Not sure who he was). I think the SSMU guy was caught off guard as well and was trying to pretend he knew of these rules the entire time. He was on the health inspectors side and told us that we should've known these rules from the club workshop (This was not told to us at the club workshop). What the health inspector told us was that mose can't be served in cardboard, news paper can't be used, we need to be serving to the customer with gloves, and the sauce has to be covered. This is all possible but the last requirement is that the food needs to be kept either above 60deg or below 4deg. This is where I think continuing samosas sales might be hard :/  edit: just read vp finances comment, maybe we will receive a fine later... who knows.. but he told us to keep selling so I hope not","Computer Science","itsapandamonium","10/23/2019, 02:01:50","t3_dlrxzr","f4u06fj"

"Having graduated and being in the workforce, I am often quite nostalgic about my time in university. I did struggle a lot as a student, but it doesn't that bad now looking back.   I definitely miss the social life and took that one for granted. Whenever I would walk around campus, I'd always stumble across some friends. We'd chit chat a bit or hang out. It was just really easy to maintain friends since they were all around the same place. I'd also go out every week and would see several of my friends for some beers. Nowadays, with everyone working, and not all in the same city, it feels like a constant battle to keep people from drifting away.   I also miss the fuckery you could get away with in college. Going out a couple times a week, pub crawls, E-weeks, Carnivals... all are things you can only get away with doing when you're young and in college. Now, you have responsibilities and too little free time to spend it hungover. To be honest, I don't really want to go on benders anymore, but I did find it fun at the time and miss that carefree spirit.

"#ATN: **ALL ONTARIO APPLICANTS**  I've been going back and forth on a very long email chain with McGill's Scholarship Office, and they've told me that McGill does not consider TGJ3M1 (Comm Tech 11) as an ""academic"" course, and thus do not include it while calculating your average -- potentially some other courses as well. This is despite their own website stating that ""ALL 3U, 3M, 4U, AND 4M"" courses should be included in the scholarship average. (there is a 96% grade 11+12 cumulative avg cutoff for major and automatic scholarship consideration)  If they aren't including it in the scholarship average, then I imagine it is the same for TGJ4M1, and some other grade 12 courses in their ADMISSIONS top 6 average calculation.  **If you know people with supposedly lower top 6s who've been accepted while you haven't, this may be why.**  Genuinely so unbelievably frustrating, non-transparent, arbitrary, and honestly just BS.","Management","toasterOnYourLeft","04/15/2021, 16:27:02","t3_kzhwd3","gumco3t"

"It's totally normal to feel a little hopeless, especially in these times, and I think it's taking a hit on a lot of people. However, suicide idealization is a serious mental health issue and I would *strongly* suggest seeking the help of a qualified professional. If you have McGill insurance it covers a big chunk of it, and if not you can see the Wellness Hub for a short term consultation or [Montreal Therapy]( for sliding scale fees. If you ever do consider suicide, please reach out to someone or give the Canadian Suicide Hotline a call at 1-833 456-4566. Therapy can also really help change your outlook on life and give you more coping strategies for when you're feeling this way. I can't recommend it enough.   I don't know how much of a help a stranger over the internet is, but please know that many people who feel like this at some point make a very full recovery and go on to live long and wonderful lives full of hope and love. COVID will surely affect the future we have, but I think it's important that we hold onto the hope that we'll get out of it eventually. Sure, the world might not be the same as before, but that doesn't mean it won't be worth living in or that COVID will only have negative outcomes. While the weather is still decent maybe try seeing some friends (masks on, socially distant) outside. The world we live in is surely really scary, but, at the cost of maybe sounding a little corny, we're all in this shit together.

">I'm starting to wonder whether governments should consider whether the horrendous mental health implications outweigh the 20/30 deaths a day from COVID, which frankly are mostly among elderly people who are likely going to die in the next few years anyway.  Oof. I really don't like that take. Eventually we're going to become old too, and I wouldn't want the younger generation to glibly say that the lives of the elderly aren't worth protecting. That kind of attitude could seriously bite us in the ass in the future. There are other ways to improve the mental health of students here at McGill without putting our elderly on a sacrificial altar. Frankly I think it's a heartless take at best.   My father is immunocompromised because he's taking chemo, and my mum has a history of pneumonia. If they got covid, they would probably die, even though they are both 65.   On top of that, we have no idea what the long term effects of COVID-19 are. It can be a nasty bug to get even if you're young (covid probably won't kill you, but it could be a terrible time), and there are 20somethings who have died from it.","German Studies & PoliSci Nut","Razwog","09/20/2020, 22:31:51","t3_iwi10g","g61fet9"

Perhaps I was a bit blunt, but I just think the way some governments (or at least my government) are going about handling it is a bit clumsy.  IMO people need to be given more the chance to take more personal responsibility - let people who want to work do so under as many precautions as possible, and focus the money and resources to make it easier for people who want or need to shield to do so, like subsidising food deliveries and working with councils to implement support groups for vulnerable people. This way people who are vulnerable to the virus don't have any pressure to go out and expose themselves to danger.  Obviously though masks and social distancing should be mandated, fuck people who think it's a 'violation of their freedom' to wear a mask. It's a miniscule inconvenience and plays a massive part in reducing the spread of the virus.","douek stan","andreasharford","09/20/2020, 22:51:46","t3_iwi10g","g61iaxx"

"I am really sorry to hear about this and I hope your dog is okay.   It's insanely difficult to solve issues related to violent events like this. The problem is that since the police is so egregiously terrible at dealing with homeless people (we're talking about continuous abuse), any active measure by the city would probably be hijacked by the police to further abuse homeless people who have done nothing wrong.  To give you an idea, the quebec government insisted they were trusting the police's judgement and years of experience exerting judgement in dealings with homeless people when they announced the curfew. A few days later a homeless man was found dead, apparently after hiding from the police in the cold.  This means that these kind of situations are extremely sensitive and difficult to ""solve"", because ""treating"" the symptoms doesn't help at all.","snowflake changed my flair","Thermidorien","04/11/2021, 17:17:03","t3_mourgc","gu5wtpw"

Regarding the the alcohol, this winter especially its a vicious cycle of lack of shelter (more limited now due to covid), drinking to keep yourself feeling warm, dependence.  Feels like these incidents have become more common in the years I've been living in Montreal, but that the problem has been pushed more and more onto the police and community organizations - the former being untrained and often harmful, the latter simply not large enough to provide all the support they want to.","Arts","tenyeartreasurybill","04/11/2021, 18:59:00","t3_mourgc","gu69fb2"

It's a sickening act what he did and NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE THREATENED LIKE THAT, it angers me beyond reason!   St. Catherine is indeed REALLY dangerous!   I was once walking down the street when a guy approached me out of nowhere and asked if I knew where the Ferris Wheel (near Old Port) was.   I have never ever been there so I said No. However, he kept insisting, and elongating the conversation for no reason at all, and he mentioned having ""his friends over and who were looking to spend a good time"".   I genuinely got scared (I started to look sideways if someone else was on the coup with him), so I insisted on the ""No"". I eventually got out of it, but it stayed on my mind for a while.   I am planning on taking self defense classes with a friend, just in case too.   Be careful and stay safe!

If I'm biaised, it's not because I'm invested in this.  >I mean hey, I respect the hussle.  But making money off of someone's disability is a no go in my books.  This is honestly the only argument in this whole thread that I feel like you should take back.  Like do we pay préposés aux bénéficiaires in gift card raffles and thank you notes? This feels like I holier than thou argument which I'll let you win if you have already contributed notes to OSD.  >Again, if you want to make money, sell your notes to lazy students. The margins are higher.  That's where things get iffi, since your notes are not your content. This is what prevents me from even putting a donate what you want link my notes.  Anyways, to finish off, I've shared my notes on FB cause I feel that the hassle of dealing with OSD is not worth the inconvenience (and that's coming from someone arguing on the internet). 1) The people from OSD likely have Facebook or friends on Facebook that can relay the notes. 2) people not in OSD might have sick days, or other shit going on in their lives keeping them from being taking notes every class.  I guess I agree that osd notaking shouldn't exist because everyone should be sharing their notes instead of hiding/trading them like cigarettes and ramen. But I have yet to see a class with many people sharing their notes.  That being said, for people working for osd, seeing one of your sources of income get slashed every year kinda sucks, cause income stability is kind've a cool thing you know. That being said, McGill admin would also probably love the same type of income stability from the government from year to year, so everyone deals with their own problems.

The reason women in particular aren't thrilled with the prospect of outright saying ""No"" isn't because they're shrews, it's about safety. Often in bars, women won't directly turn down guys because of the chance that they might do something shitty.   You might say ""hey, but it's different online"" but most of the same instincts not to engage still apply.

"I think it's important to stay level-headed when it comes to these things and remember that the PQ is a party that has become very marginalized in the last 5 years, and they no longer represent a significant proportion of quebecois when they make statements like this.   I think some of the comments you are referring to kind of over-interprets the lack of university funding from the government. All universities in Quebec are underfunded at the moment (UdeM being a mild exception due to the AI stuff but that's a long story) and while there is a major issue with financing education in Quebec which is linked to the low tuition Quebec students pay (paying low tuition is good but it's expensive to the government), I think the underfunding of McGill is more due to the general underfunding of universities in Quebec than animosity from Quebec.   McGill actually thrived in the 2000s and reached high peaks in rankings after decades of existence under francophone Quebec governments because the Quebec political class cared about education in general back then, and no longer cares now. At least not enough to face the rising costs associated with existing as a university.  Don't get me wrong, you will find intolerant people who really dislike the fact that the best university in Quebec operates in English, but I don't think they represent a majority or even that strong of a minority. If they did, the PQ would not be constantly attacking the CAQ for ""funding mcgill too much"", and mcgill would not have escaped bill 96 (or bill 21 for that matter). Not that either bill is a good bill. I just think it's important to understand that McGill has a lot of qc franco students, a lot of qc franco administrators, and is a big participant to life in Montreal and a big piece of the Quebec public education system.  I understand that the recent anglophobic (I don't think there's any other word that's appropriate at this point) stances from the PQ since they got their new leader sound really bad. I'm not claiming that they don't, they really do, because they completely exclude the possibility of francophones benefiting from English education and their general stance about the funding of English education is complete nonsense. I just really want to stress that this party is polling very poorly in Quebec and even worse in Montreal, that they are currently projected to get around 2 seats out of 125 next elections, and that the reason they are so loud is specifically because their message no longer matches what the population wants and they're getting desperate.  I don't think there's any reason McGill can't thrive in Quebec like it did 10 to 20 years ago. We just need a government that actually cares about education and updates university funding to standards that are reasonable in the 2020s.","snowflake changed my flair","Thermidorien","06/10/2021, 22:22:15","t3_nwukcn","h1c2wbm"

Like having to stay home for two weeks means missing up to 6 labs for me (lectures as well but those are recorded so it's fine). Profs are supposed to provide some sort of accommodations but really what that's going to mean in the end, usually, is not being able to do something to make up for it it's going to be like redistributing the weight onto an exam or some other labs or smth, which ig there's not much else that can be done, but still would definitely suck.

"I'd say avoid a building if their tenants are mostly students. They know that most of the students don't actually know the laws, and that you most probably won't go to the Regie if you have a problem.  That being said, take pictures/videos when you have a problem and just go to the regie.  I heard that a building in the ghetto asks $200 as a move-out fee. What the hell?  Most of the apartment buildings are quite old, and you're going to have problems. But at least I get notified well in advance if someone's going to enter my apartment, because if they don't , they know that someone that's been living in the building for 30 something years is going to yell at them.  I live on Cote Sainte Catherine and Mont-Royal, paying $1550 for a 2-bedroom with hot water & heating included, which isn't cheap at all but not as expensive as other buildings in the ghetto or lower plateau.

"I knew that housing in the ghetto wasn't good, but these nightmarish stories by other users have really driven home this point.  I'm glad that I now live in NDG paying $650 a month for a large 1.5 (technically the size of a 2.5, \~350 square feet) and my building is managed by a large property management firm. Not gonna mention names here bcus I don't want others to misinterpret this as a complaint since this is a ""do not rent"" thread. While my apartment is old-ish and will be due for renovation soon, I've had no complaints with the management and the few times that I've asked them for repairs, they usually come on the same day and fix them without issues (and the repairman is pretty friendly too). They're also quite good at communicating with us by leaving notices on our doors  and in common areas well in advance of any important events (e.g., lease renewal, fire alarm testing, releve 31 tax form pick-up). I also have a fitness center, swimming pool (all closed due to COVID) and dep in the basement too (at no extra charge), and all utilities are included in my rent. Sound and thermal insulation is pretty good too and the only time I hear my neighbours is when they turn their subwoofers on and have a dance party (not that often).  They've also made nice renovations to the common areas since I moved in 1.5 years ago and installed a contactless key card system for the main entrance and made the building more accessible to wheelchair users.  This is in stark contrast to when I was living in the Ghetto along Sainte-Famille near Prince Arthur from 2016 to 2018. I was paying around $850 for a tiny 2.5 (technically the size of a 1.5, 200 square feet) and the sound insulation was meh as I could hear my neighbours' footsteps upstairs a lot of the time. The landlord was responsive to repair requests though. Still, this was a pretty expensive rental in retrospect, given that I saved $200 a month by moving out of downtown to NDG and getting an apartment that's >50% bigger.","Pharmacology","FieldsOfJoy","04/25/2020, 14:33:54","t3_g7i7yb","fojndwi"

The land lady is very cooky. The first floor smoke is tolerable for me cause you only use it to enter but do not live on her floor which is third if you live here! I’m sorry she said racist comments; I definitely hear some inappropriate things a lot, luckily hasn’t been directed at me (yet). If you do something wrong she gets overly mad, so I really try and stay on her good side. She actually helped me find a sublet so I appreciated her for that! She is something to consider when living here though, but IMO the worst is some unpleasant conversations about other tenants because she likes to rant.  I actually think the price is worth it overall, like looking at the comments people paid 1k+ for much worst management. The worst thing that’s happened to me is sometimes smoke smell travels, but I’ve had this in every apartment and residence too.

"i lived there and actually (considering this was several years ago) for the time it was pretty cheap. I actually had an pretty large amount of problems with them though, Gabrielle and her mother (?) as well as other people I knew who lived in the building all had problems as well. The worst of it was when they encouraged us to renovate our kitchen in our unit citing that it would take 2-3 weeks, and in total we were left for about 2 months without a kitchen or living room. Other friends of ours had also issues with their units being in various states of renovations that took a very long time.  I was told by some of the contractors that a large reason why it took long was because many people got frustrated working with the mother lol. I also just feel betrayed because all along signing the lease I dealt with the father (?) George who disappeared as soon as we moved in and we only dealt with the mother.  This isn't to mention other things like the way they deal with people and hounding tenants for various infractions.

Plus I’d rather be a little too hot than too cold. Landlord is intense but very efficient and location is really great with apartments that are in good condition (some are newer/more renovated than others).

"I think it's nostalgic more than super nice, and that's why people like it so much.  When I look at it, I remember all the good times, all the shit times, all the friends I met, all the walloppings I took at intramurals, the great profs, the courses I horribly fucked up, the fucked up parties I've seen, the research that worked, the research that was shit, getting fucked up on caffeine in the library to the point where you can on longer be productive, Sangria wednesdays, begging on my knees in front of Big Suze to not call my mom and tell her I've been drunk 4/7 days in that past week, blackout specials, the treks up the hills in 40 cm of snow, climbing the mountain while blind drunk, baking in the sun at Tams, the endless construction, shaking my damn head at the SSMU drama. And so much more...   So yeah, I see that building and all of that comes flooding back and makes me think ""Man, what a nice building, McGill was a such a good time of my life"". Reading this over I might be an idiot LOL. But that is how I see it :)","M2 Chemistry","bigmoko","07/11/2019, 14:57:54","t3_cbv2fn","etipt4x"

"I don't know why people are downvoting you when Concordia literally has a superior library, much better food options around campus, good fine arts programs McGill doesn't offer, and from what I've heard, proportionally more helpful advisers.  Sure, I'll laugh at a funny Concordia joke because McGill is still better, but dredging up a screenshot from urbandictionary.com circa 2009 is just sad. Where is the snark directed toward UQAM? Now that's a university we can all flex on.","Geography '20","The12thDoc","05/24/2019, 20:57:44","t3_bsk5yj","eoo7l9a"
"Don’t diss UQÀM - their security guards on the science campus are the best. If you forget your bike lock or yours breaks, they’ll loan you a really tough Abus lock. They also check every bike in the racks periodically to make sure it’s locked properly - if it’s not, they’ll use one of their loaner locks to secure it and leave a note saying to go to their front desk (which is staffed 24/7) to ask them to unlock it when you’re ready to leave.   They also go on regular patrols through every hallway of every building to make sure things are ok.","Not an authority figure '20","CatanOverlord","05/24/2019, 21:04:28","t3_bsk5yj","eoo847m"
