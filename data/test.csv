"I'm kinda surprised, but I guess it makes sense.  That Couche-Tard is a research project between Desautels and the ECSE department. Notably, it's also on McGill campus.  [I challenge you to find bottled water to buy *anywhere* on campus](","Not Software Eng"

"I can’t comment on your specific situation, but in my experience, a quick email or call to the FRQ representative resolved things. As of 2 years ago, the FRQNT rule was 1 TA per semester max, and that could not be more than 180 hours.   With FRQNT, you couldn’t hold 2 TA positions of 50 hours each, but 1 that was 180 hours was fine.   Do the FRQS rules say 225? I’m not sure why you’re saying under 225 or over 45, do they have rules about that? I would assume they still have the one position rule, but I’d still double check the FRQS rules.","Mech Eng"
"So iirc the rules are that you can only do ''one job'' for less than the hours limit. Most people do take one TA position for semester with a FRQ and are just fine.","snowflake changed my flair"
"Fwiw, I know numerous people who took on-campus jobs (TA, RA, etc.) that put them over the stipulated hourly limit while on funding (FRQSC, SSHRC, etc.) and nothing happened. I don't think anyone is checking.","M.A. (Master’s in Anxiety)"
"Neat! I would interpret that 45 hours “teaching load” to be the actual lecturer for a 3-credit course, and “remunerated work” to be TAships/graders. Either way, you’re right, it’s much safer to confirm it with the FRQS.","Mech Eng"
"This should cover all the starting letters of the names in the class. Is your name not in any of the ranges?","snowflake changed my flair"
"It's last names, and those are the first three letters of names.  So first room is last names starting in Aaa to Dui... etc.","snowflake changed my flair"
